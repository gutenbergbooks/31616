<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Scarcely one half of the children of our country
continue in school much beyond the fifth grade. It is
important, therefore, that so far as possible the knowledge
which has most to do with human welfare should be
presented in the early years of school life.</p>

<p>Fisher, Metchnikoff, Sedgwick, and others have shown
that the health of a people influences the prosperity and
happiness of a nation more than any other one thing.
The highest patriotism is therefore the conservation of
health. The seven hundred thousand lives annually
destroyed by infectious diseases and the million other
serious cases of sickness from contagious maladies, with
all their attendant suffering, are largely sacrifices on the
altar of ignorance. The loving mother menaces the life
of her babe by feeding it milk with a germ content nearly
half as great as that of sewage, the anemic girl sleeps
with fast-closed windows, wondering in the morning why
she feels so lifeless, and the one-time vigorous boy goes
to a consumptive's early grave, because they did not know
(what every school ought to teach) the way to health.</p>

<p>Doctor Price, the Secretary of the State Board of Health
of Maryland, recently said before the American Public
Health Association that the text-books of our schools show
a marked disregard for the urgent problems which enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
our daily life, such as the prevention of tuberculosis,
typhoid fever, and acute infectious diseases.</p>

<p>Since the observing public have seen educated communities
decrease their death rate from typhoid fever,
tuberculosis, and diphtheria from one third to three
fourths by heeding the health call, lawmakers are becoming
convinced that the needless waste of human life should
be stopped. Michigan has already decreed that every
school child shall be taught the cause and prevention of
the communicable diseases, and several other states are
contemplating like action. This book meets fully the
demands of all such laws as are contemplated, and presents
the important truths not by dogmatic assertion, but by
citing specific facts appealing to the child mind in such
a way as to make a lasting impression.</p>

<p>After the eleventh year of age, the first cause of death
among school children is tuberculosis. The chief aim of
the author has been to show the child the sure way of
preventing this disease and others of like nature, and
to establish an undying faith in the motto of Pasteur,
"It is within the power of man to rid himself of every
parasitic disease."</p>

<p>Nearly all of the illustrations used are from photographs
and drawings specially prepared for this book. These,
together with the large amount of material gleaned from
original sources and from the author's experiments in the
laboratory, will, it is hoped, make this little volume
worthy of the same generous welcome accorded the two
earlier books of this series.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>CARING FOR THE HEALTH</h3>

<p><b>Good Health better than Gold.</b>&mdash;Horses and houses,
balls and dolls, and much else that people think they
want to make them happy can be bought with
money. The one thing which is worth more than
all else cannot be bought with even a houseful of
gold. This thing is good health. Over three million
persons in our country are now sick, and many
of them are suffering much pain. Some of them
would give all the money they have to gain once
more the good health which the poorest may usually
enjoy by right living day by day.</p>

<p><b>How long shall you live?</b>&mdash;In this country most of
the persons born live to be over forty years of age, and
some live more than one hundred years. A hundred
years ago most persons died before the age of thirty-five
years. In London three hundred years ago only about
one half of those born reached the age of twenty-five
years. Scarcely one half of the people in India to-day
live beyond the age of twenty-five years. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
people in India are dying nearly twice as fast as in
our own country. This is because they have not
learned how to take care of the body in India so well
as we have.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 1</span>
&mdash;By right living this woman remained in good health for several years
after she was a century old.</p>
</div>

<p>The study which
tells how to keep well
is <i>Hygiene</i>. Whether
you keep well and live
long, or suffer much
from headaches, cold,
and other sickness,
depends largely on
how you care for your
body.</p>

<p><b>Working together
for Health.</b>&mdash;One cannot
always keep well
and strong by his own
efforts. The grocer
and milkman may sell to you bad food, the town
may furnish impure water, churches and schools may
injure your health by failing to supply fresh air in
their buildings. More than a hundred thousand people
were made very sick last year through the use of
water poisoned by waste matter which other persons
carelessly let reach the streams and wells. Many of
the sick died of the fever caused by this water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Although it cannot be said that we are engaged in
real war, yet we are surely killing one another by
our thoughtless habits in scattering disease. We
must therefore not only know how to care for our
own bodies, but teach all to help one another to keep
well.</p>

<p><b>A Lesson from War.</b>&mdash;The mention of war makes
those who know its terrors shudder. Disease has
caused more than ten times as much suffering and
death as war with its harvest of mangled bodies,
shattered limbs, and blinded eyes. In our four
months' war with Spain in 1898 only 268 soldiers
were killed in battle, while nearly 4000 brave men
died from disease. We lost more than ten men by
disease to every one killed by bullets.</p>

<p>In the late war between Japan and Russia the
Japanese soldiers cared for their health so carefully
that only one fourth as many died from disease as
perished in battle. This shows that with care for
the health the small men of Japan saved themselves
from disease, and thus won a victory told around the
world.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 2</span>
&mdash;The Surgeon General who, by keeping the soldiers well, helped Japan
win in the war against Russia.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Battle with Disease.</b>&mdash;For long ages sickness
has caused more sorrow, misery, and death
than famine, war, and wild beasts. Many years ago
a plague called the <i>black death</i> swept over most
of the earth, and killed nearly one third of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
inhabitants. A little more than a hundred years
ago yellow fever killed thousands of people in
Philadelphia and New York in a few weeks. When
Boston was a city
with a population of
11,000, more than
one half of the persons
had smallpox in
one year. Within a
few years one half
of the sturdy red men
of our forests were
slain by smallpox
when it first visited
our shores. Before
the year 1798 few
boys or girls reached
the age of twenty
years without a pit-marked
face due to
the dreadful disease
of smallpox. This
disease was formerly more common than measles and
chicken pox now are because we had not yet learned
how to prevent it as we do to-day.</p>

<p><b>Victory over Disease.</b>&mdash;Cholera, yellow fever,
black death, and smallpox no longer cause people to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
flee into the wilderness to escape them when they
occasionally break out in a town or city. We have
learned how to prevent these ailments among people
who will obey the
laws of health.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i012" id="i012"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 3</span>
&mdash;One of the thousands of sturdy red men which smallpox slew before
we learned how to prevent the disease.</p>
</div>

<p>Until the year
1900, people fled from
a city when yellow
fever was announced,
but now any one can
sleep with a fever
patient and not catch
the disease, because
we have learned how
to prevent it. Nurses
and doctors no longer
hesitate to sit for
hours in the rooms of
those sick with smallpox
because they
know how to treat the body to keep away this disease.
By studying this book, boys and girls may learn not
only how to keep free from these diseases, but how to
manage their bodies to make them strong enough to
escape other diseases.</p>

<p><b>As the Twig is bent so the Tree is inclined.</b>&mdash;This
old saying means that a strong, straight, healthy, full-grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
tree cannot come from a weak and bent young
tree. Health in manhood and womanhood depends
on how the health is cared for in childhood. The
foundation for disease is often laid during school
years. The making of strong bodies that will live
joyous lives for long years must begin in boyhood
and girlhood.</p>

<p>In youth is the time to begin right living. Bad
habits formed in early life often cause much sorrow
in later years. It is said that over one half the
drunkards began drinking liquor before they were
twenty years of age and most of the smokers began
to use tobacco before they were twenty years old.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>PARTS OF THE BODY</h3>

<p><b>Regions of the Body.</b>&mdash;In order to talk about any
part of the body it must have a name. The main
portion of the body is called the <i>trunk</i>. At the top
of the trunk is the <i>head</i>. The arms and legs are
known as <i>limbs</i> or <i>extremities</i>. The part of the arm
between the elbow and wrist is the <i>forearm</i>. The
<i>thigh</i> is the part of the leg between the knee and hip.</p>

<p>The upper part of the trunk is called the <i>chest</i> and
is encircled by the ribs. The lower part of the trunk
is named the <i>abdomen</i>. A large cavity within the
chest contains the lungs and heart. The cavity of
the abdomen is filled with the liver, stomach, food
tube, and other working parts.</p>

<p><b>The Plan of the Body.</b>&mdash;All parts of the body are
not the same. One part has one kind of work to do
while another performs quite a different duty. The
covering of the body is the <i>skin</i>. Beneath is the red
meat called <i>muscle</i>. It looks just like the beef bought
at the butcher shop which is the muscle of a cow or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
ox. Nearly one half of the weight of the body is
made of muscle.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 175px;">
<a name="i015" id="i015"></a>
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="175" height="322" alt="The Organs" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 4</span>
&mdash;General plan of the organs of the body.</p>
</div>

<p>The muscle is fastened to the <i>bones</i> which support
the body and give
it stiffness. The
muscle by pulling
on the bones helps
the body to do all
kinds of work.
The muscles and
bones cannot work
day after day
without being fed.
For this reason a
food tube leads
from the mouth
down into the
trunk to prepare
milk, meat, bread,
or other food, for
the use of the
body.</p>

<p><b>Feeding the
Body.</b>&mdash;The
mouth receives
the food and chews it so that it may be easily
swallowed. It then goes into a sac called the <i>stomach</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Here the hard parts are broken up into tiny bits
and float about in a watery fluid. This goes out of
the stomach into a long crooked tube, the <i>intestine</i>.
Here the particles are made still finer, and the whole
mass is then ready to be carried to every part of the
muscles, bones, and brain to build up what is being
worn out in work and play.</p>

<p><b>Carrying Food through the Body.</b>&mdash;In all parts of
the body are little branching tubes. These unite into
larger tubes leading to the heart. Through these
tubes flows <i>blood</i>. Hundreds of tiny tubes in the
walls of the intestine drink in the watery food, and
it flows with the blood to the heart. The heart then
pushes this blood with its food out through another
set of tubes which divide into fine branches as they
lead to every part of the body (<a href="#i018">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p><b>Getting rid of Ashes and Worn-out Parts.</b>&mdash;The
body works like a machine. Food is used somewhat
as a locomotive uses coal to give it power
to work. Some ashes are left from the used food,
and other waste matter is formed by the dead
and worn-out parts of the body. This waste is
gathered up by the richly branching blood tubes
and carried to the lungs. Here some of it passes
out at every breath. Part of the waste goes out
through the skin with the sweat and part passes
out through the kidneys. In this way the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]<br />[Pg 19]</a></span>
matter is kept from collecting in the body and
clogging its parts.</p>

<p><b>How the Parts of the Body are made to work Together.</b>&mdash;The
mass of red flesh covering the bones is
made up of many pieces called muscles. Whenever
we catch a ball or run or even speak, more than a
dozen muscles must be made to act together just in
the right way. When food goes into the stomach,
something must tell the juice to flow out of the walls
to act on the food. The boss or manager of all the
work carried on by the thousands of parts of the body
is known as the <i>brain</i> and <i>spinal cord</i> with their tiny
threads, the <i>nerves</i>, spreading everywhere through
bones and muscles. The brain and spinal cord give
the orders and the nerves carry them (<a href="#i018">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Servants of the Body.</b>&mdash;The parts of the body
are much like the servants in a large house or the
clerks in a store. One servant or clerk does one kind
of work while another does something entirely different.
Each portion of the body does a different
kind of work. Each one of these parts doing a particular
work is called an <i>organ</i>. The stomach is an
organ to prepare food and the heart is an organ for
sending the blood through the body.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 5</span>
&mdash;On the left are shown the branching tubes which carry blood to all
parts of the body; on the right are the brain, spinal cord, and nerves
which direct the work of the organs.</p>
</div>

<p>The entire body is composed of several hundred
organs. Each of them is formed of several kinds of
materials named <i>tissue</i>. A skinlike tissue makes up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the lining of the stomach, while its outside is made of
muscular tissue. The smallest parts of a tissue are little
bodies named <i>cells</i>, and very fine threads called <i>fibers</i>.</p>

<p><b>Growth of the Body.</b>&mdash;The body grows rapidly in
childhood and more slowly after the sixteenth year,
but it continues to get larger until about the twenty-fifth
year of age. Some children always grow slowly,
have weak bones, and frail bodies. This is generally
so because they have poor food or do not chew it
well, and get too little fresh air, sunshine, and sleep.</p>

<p>The use of beer, wine, or tobacco may hinder the
body from using food for growth, or they may poison
the body so that it will never be large and strong.
The body should grow about a hundred pounds in
weight during the first thirteen years of life. Whether
children grow little or much generally depends on the
food they give their bodies.</p>

<h3>FEEDING THE BODY</h3>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i020" id="i020"></a>
<img src="images/i020.jpg" width="150" height="133" alt="Black Snake" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 6</span>
&mdash;Photograph of the outer dead skin pushed off from a black snake crawling through the brush.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Why the Body needs Food.</b>&mdash;Every living thing,
whether a plant or an animal, needs food. While the
whole body lives, a part of it is constantly dying.
The entire outer layer
of a snake's skin dies
three or four times
during a year and is
cast off, sometimes in
a single piece. We
can scrape dead bits
of skin from the surface
of our body at
any time. Tiny particles
are dying in all
regions of the body,
and we should soon waste away if food were not
taken to make up the loss for the worn-out parts.</p>

<p>The body also needs food to help it do its work
and keep warm. The body has the strange power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
using food eaten to make the legs and arms move
and the brain to think. In doing this the body is
said to burn the food.</p>

<p><b>How the Body burns itself and also Food.</b>&mdash;If a
boy is weighed just before playing a game of ball and
again afterward, he will find that part of his body
has been used up and given off in the breath and
sweat. He has burned part of his body, and the
breath and sweat are like the smoke given off when
a match is burned.</p>

<p>One fifth of the air is made of a gas called <i>oxygen</i>.
When anything becomes very hot, this oxygen makes
it burst into a flame and burn. We breathe in oxygen
with the air and the living action of the body
causes such a slow union of the oxygen and the tissues
that there is no blaze although there is a little heat.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Food.</b>&mdash;There are four general classes of
foods. These are the <i>building foods</i>, the <i>sugars</i> and
<i>starches</i>, the <i>fats</i>, and the <i>mineral foods</i>. The building
foods are those which help largely in forming new
muscle and blood or other parts of the body. <i>Proteids</i>
is another name for building foods.</p>

<p><i>Sugars</i> and <i>starches</i> are placed in one group because
starch changes to sugar within the body. If
you chew a starchy food like bread for a few minutes,
it will begin to taste sweet because the starch
is becoming sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>Fats are got not only from fat meat but also
from eggs, butter, milk, and many other foods.
There is some mineral matter, such as potash and
soda, in many of the vegetables and meats eaten, and
we use much table salt to season other foods.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i022" id="i022"></a>
<img src="images/i022.jpg" width="500" height="292" alt="Good Foods" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 7</span>
&mdash;Good foods for building muscles, blood, and bone.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Body-building Foods.</b>&mdash;A person with all the sugar,
molasses, starch, butter, and lard he could eat would
starve to death in a few weeks because none of these
foods would help to build up the dying parts of the
body. A large amount of body builder is found in
lean meat, eggs, milk, peas, beans, corn meal, and
bread. Bread and milk is a good food to make
the body grow. If the body takes in more building
food than it needs for repairs, it may store it up in the
form of fat or burn it to help the body do its work.</p>

<p><b>The Fuel Foods.</b>&mdash;The fuel foods are the sugars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
starches, and fats. These are the foods which the
body can easily burn to keep it warm and give it
power to act. Candy, molasses, or sugar in any form,
taken in small quantities, is a good food. Starch,
which the body quickly changes to sugar, is a much
cheaper food. Meats contain very little starch, but
nearly all vegetables contain much starch. Three
fourths of corn meal, rice, wheat flour, and soda
crackers consists of starch. More than one half of
white bread, dried beans, and peas is made of pure
starch, and there is much starch in potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Fat</i> is more abundant in animal than in vegetable
food. Castor oil and cotton-seed oil are fats from
vegetables. The fat of the cow is called <i>suet</i> or
<i>tallow</i>, while the fat of the hog is known as <i>lard</i>.
<i>Butter</i> is the fat collected from milk. Cream and
eggs contain much fat. When persons eat too much
of the sugars, starches, or fats, the body may store
them up as fat. For this reason thin persons wishing
to gain in flesh eat eggs, nuts, and rich milk.</p>

<p><b>The Mineral Foods.</b>&mdash;The body must have not only
lime to help form the bones, but iron, salt, soda, and
potash for other parts of the body. All these minerals
except salt are found in many of the common foods.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 8</span>
&mdash;Good foods for giving the body power and heat.</p>
</div>

<p>Water is one of the most important of the mineral
foods because it helps the body use all the other
foods. Most people drink too little water to enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the best health. The body needs more than two
quarts of water every day. There is much water in
our foods. More than one half of eggs, meat, and
potatoes is made of water, and more than three
fourths of tomatoes, green corn, onions, cabbage, and
string beans is composed of water. We should drink
one quart or more of water daily. It should not be used
ice cold, and very little should be taken at meal time.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 9</span>
&mdash;Diagram showing how the drainage from a house with a sick person
caused one hundred and twenty cases of typhoid fever at Mount Savage, Maryland.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Water and Health.</b>&mdash;One of the common causes
of sickness is bad water. Water from shallow wells
within a hundred feet of barnyards, pigpens, or
other outhouses is usually unsafe to drink. At Newport,
Rhode Island, more than eighty persons were
made sick with the fever by drinking the water
from a well only ten feet deep. The impure water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
from one spring at Trenton, New Jersey, gave the fever
to nearly a hundred persons in one season. At Mount
Savage, Maryland, a hundred and
twenty persons were made ill
by using the water
from a spring near a
house drain.</p>

<p>Water from rivers and streams running near where
many people live is likely to be made impure and is
sure to bring sickness and death to some of those who
use it. Water from a small stream at Plymouth,
Pennsylvania, running past a house occupied by a
typhoid patient, gave the fever to over a thousand
persons in one month. The water from a small stream
at Ithaca, New York, gave the fever to over thirteen
hundred people in one season, and an almost equal
number caught the fever in a few weeks at Butler,
Pennsylvania, by drinking water from a small creek
along which some sick persons lived.</p>

<p><b>Preventing Sickness from Bad Water.</b>&mdash;It is better
to go thirsty than to drink water which is likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]<br />[Pg 28]</a></span>
cause sickness. Any water can be made safe by boiling
it one minute. Boiled water is the most healthful
kind of water to use. The people of China and
Japan seldom use water that has not been boiled.</p>

<p>Many cities using water from rivers run it through a
layer of sand and gravel to remove the tiny things
that cause so much sickness and death. This makes
the water very much purer, but it is not so certain to
make the water safe as is boiling it. Bad water
makes nearly a quarter of a million of our people sick
every year and kills twenty thousand of them.</p>

<p><b>How much Food does the Body Need?</b>&mdash;Most people
eat too much. Overeating overworks the stomach,
poisons the body, makes one feel lazy, and causes
headache. If you chew your food fine and stop eating
as soon as hunger is satisfied without tempting the
appetite with sweets, you are not likely to overeat.</p>

<p>About one seventh of a pound of building food is
needed daily to keep the body in repair, and a quarter
of a pound of fat and a pound of starches and sugars
are required to help the body do a hard day's work.
A half pound of bread, beans, and meat each, a
pound of potatoes, a pint of milk, and a quarter of a
pound of butter and sugar each, will give a working
man all the food he needs for a day.</p>

waste from one sick room was thrown on the bank of a stream which
several miles below supplied the town with water and caused over one
thousand cases of fever and more than a hundred deaths within seven weeks.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Beer and Wine as Foods.</b>&mdash;It was once thought
that beer and wine were good foods, but hundreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 28]<br />[Pg 29]</a></span>
late experiments show that these drinks are very poor
and expensive foods. A half glass of milk is of more
use to the body as a food than a full quart of beer.
The use of much wine or beer may seem to satisfy
the appetite because they deaden the real feeling of
hunger. Neither of these drinks can be used by the
young without danger of doing much harm.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i028" id="i028"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>FOOD AND HEALTH</h3>

<p><b>Meats.</b>&mdash;Beef is the best of all meat for food.
Nearly one fifth of it can be used to repair the worn-out
parts of the body. Mutton, the meat of sheep,
is almost as good for food as beef. Veal and pork
also contain much body-building matter, but the
stomach must work hard to prepare them for use.</p>

<p>Fish is an excellent food, but it has only little more
than one half as much flesh-building matter as good
beef. Poultry is a healthful food, especially for the
weak and sick, but it is more expensive than the
other meats. Oysters are largely made of water and
do not contain much to strengthen the body.</p>

<p>In all meat there is some waste matter. This may
harm the body if we eat too much meat. It is no
longer thought healthful for most persons to eat meat
more than once a day. Too much meat used daily
for several years is likely to cause disease.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i030" id="i030"></a>
<img src="images/i030.jpg" width="150" height="262" alt="Bread" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 12</span>
&mdash;Each of these articles costs the same, but the bread will furnish four
times as much food for the body as the cabbage, more than twice as much as
the fish, and nearly twice as much as the milk.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Cooking of Meat.</b>&mdash;The best meat if poorly
cooked is unfit for eating. Broiled and roasted meats
are more healthful than boiled or fried meat. Meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
is broiled by holding it in a wire frame over a
flame or hot coals. It is roasted by placing it
in a covered pan in a
hot oven for two or
three hours. It is
boiled by keeping it
in hot water several
hours.</p>

<p>Meat is fried by
cooking it in lard or
other fat in a pan.
Only those who have
strong bodies should
eat fried meat.</p>

<p>The cheap cuts of
meat from the neck,
breast, and legs have
about as much food
matter in them as
the more costly parts.
Such meat may be
made more tender
by boiling than by
roasting.</p>

<p><b>Soup.</b>&mdash;Soup, broth, and beef tea furnish but little
food for the body. They are very useful in giving us
a good appetite for the real food to be eaten later.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
They make the stomach go to work more quickly
than other food. Soup or broth is made from meat
by placing it on the stove in cold water, gradually
heating it, and then keeping it hot several hours.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 13</span>
&mdash;Either group of foods will give the body the same strength
and nourishment for work and growth.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Vegetables.</b>&mdash;Some persons never eat meat of any
kind because they enjoy better health when using
only vegetables, milk, and eggs. Peas and beans contain
much matter for making new flesh and blood
and also much starch to give heat and power to the
body. Potatoes form a valuable food. Roasted potatoes
are more healthful than those boiled or fried.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i032" id="i032"></a>
<img src="images/i032.jpg" width="500" height="428" alt="Real food" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 14</span>
&mdash;The amount of real food in these articles.</p>
</div>

<p>Radishes, onions, and cucumbers are made largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of water. Only a small amount of these should be
eaten at one meal as the stomach must work hard to
make use of them. Young beets, lettuce, and ripe
tomatoes may be eaten by young and old. They
contain useful minerals and help keep the body in
a healthful condition.</p>

<p><b>The Cereals or Grain Foods.</b>&mdash;These foods are eaten
in the form of bread, oatmeal, corn meal, rice, and
breakfast foods. All of these furnish much matter
to strengthen the body and make it grow. Bread
and butter with rice are excellent foods for children.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 100px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 15</span>
&mdash;A bottle of beer. The dotted part at the top shows
how much body-building food it contains.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Fruits.</b>&mdash;Very few people can remain well long
without eating fruit of some kind. Ripe apples,
pears, plums, peaches, berries, and cherries furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
useful salts to the body and also help the stomach
and food tube do their work in a more healthful way.
Fruits also increase the appetite. Green fruit and
fruit which is overripe should never be eaten.</p>

<p><b>Eggs.</b>&mdash;Eggs form a good food for nearly everybody,
but they are specially needed by the young and
other persons with weak bodies. They can repair the
worn-out parts of the body and also help it do its
work.</p>

<p>Eggs are most healthful when eaten raw or soft
cooked. The best way to cook them through evenly
is to put them in a pan off the stove and add about
a quart of boiling water for every three eggs. Cover
and let them cook fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Eggs should be kept in a cold room or cellar until
used. They become stale in less than a week when
left in a warm living room and may get a bad taste
when only three or four days old.</p>

<p><b>Salt, Pepper, and Vinegar.</b>&mdash;Eating much salt is
harmful. A small quantity of salt and pepper increases
the appetite and makes the stomach do its
work better. Children should use very little pepper
and almost no vinegar and mustard.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco.</b>&mdash;Some people think tobacco is a food because
it is made from the leaves of a plant. Other
people think tobacco is a food because they do not
feel hungry after smoking or chewing it. The truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
is that tobacco is of no use to the body
as a food and may do it much harm
because of the poison it contains.
Tobacco satisfies hunger somewhat by
deadening the parts of the body that
are calling for food.</p>

<p><b>Beer.</b>&mdash;The people who make beer
and sell it say that it is a food. Men
who have no interest in selling beer,
and have experimented with it to find
out whether it strengthens the body, say
that beer should never be used as a food.
It often tends to weaken the body.
Children should never use beer at any
time, and older people can sometimes avoid disease
by letting it alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>HOW PLANTS SOUR OR SPOIL FOOD</h3>

<p><b>Germs, Microbes, or Bacteria.</b>&mdash;The dust and dirt of
all sorts contain thousands of tiny plants too small
to be seen by the eye without help. An instrument
called a <i>microscope</i> makes them appear so large that
their form and growth are easily studied. These
little plants are called <i>germs</i> or <i>microbes</i>. They are
also named <i>bacteria</i>. They are so small that a million
laid side by side would not cover the head of a pin.</p>

shape of tiny rods. Many of them which look just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
alike act very different in growing. There are more
than twenty different kinds that grow in our bodies
and cause diphtheria, tuberculosis, and other diseases.
We have measles and scarlet fever because we have
gotten these disease germs from some one else in
whom they were growing.</p>

sack; 1, 2, and 4, one of the seed bodies after one, two, and four hours' growth. Much
enlarged.</p>
</div>

<p>Most germs feed on dead matter instead of our
living bodies and make it melt away or change into
another form. An
apple or a piece of
meat thrown out
on the ground will
soon change and
become like the
earth on which it
lies. The change,
called decay, is
caused by millions
of germs. The
farmer's best friends are certain germs which help
make the ground rich, so that the crops will grow.</p>

<p><b>Mold.</b>&mdash;The dust raised in sweeping contains tiny
living seedlike bodies. If these fall on bread, cheese,
or fruit, and this food is afterward kept moist in a
warm room for a day or two, they will grow into
grayish fluffy spots. These spots are mold. The
greenish white growth on the top of some canned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
fruit and on berries left in the warm kitchen over
night is also mold.</p>

<p>Mold is a plant which grows from tiny round
bodies acting like seeds (<a href="#i036">Fig. 17</a>). These seed bodies
of mold are common in all dust and often fly through
the air. On this account food should be kept covered
when possible and especially when one is sweeping.
Some mold gives bread, cheese, and other food a bad
taste, but it will not make one sick.</p>

<p><b>How Germs Grow.</b>&mdash;Germs will not grow where it
is very cold, but freezing the germs does not kill them.
Boiling one minute kills most germs. Drying will
stop the germs from growing, but will not kill all of
them. Sunlight kills many of them.</p>

<p>Moisture and warmth make germs grow rapidly.
A germ in growing lengthens out a little and then
divides in the middle. It does this so quickly that
one germ may become two in fifteen minutes. Each
of these will then divide. In this way one germ can
make many million germs in a single day (<a href="#i038">Fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p><b>The Spoiling of Meat.</b>&mdash;Fresh meat will not remain
good even one day if left in a warm place. A large
greenish blue fly seen buzzing about in warm weather
will sometimes lay its eggs on meat. These will hatch
the next day into little worms, called maggots. They
grow rapidly and a few days later change into flies.</p>

&mdash;Drawing of the germ at the top every ten minutes, showing how

</div>

<p>Germs will also spoil meat not kept cold. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
feed on the meat and give off a poison, making it
unfit to eat. The bad odor tells when the germs are
at work. Every home should have
a cold cellar or an ice box to keep
food from spoiling.</p>

<p><b>Saving Food from Souring.</b>&mdash;The
souring of milk and of cooked food
of any kind is due to the germs
always present in the air and clinging
by the thousands to unwashed
dishes and hands. If meat or fruit
is cooked and kept tightly covered,
it will remain good for years. Many persons save
fruit and vegetables for use in winter by putting
them in jars, which are heated to kill the germs, and
sealed tight to keep out other germs.</p>

<p><b>Yeast or the Alcohol Plant.</b>&mdash;Sweet cider and other
fruit juices are sometimes spoiled by a plant named
yeast. This plant has the form of a football and is
so small that a million of its kind together would not
make a mass as large as the head of a pin. It floats
about in the air and is present on the skins of fruits.</p>

<p>Yeast is also called the alcohol plant because whenever
it grows in a sweet substance like fruit juice it
changes part of it into a biting substance called alcohol.
At the same time it gives off a gas. It is this
gas which forms the bubbling or frothing in beer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>The millions of yeast plants in the yeast cake
bought at the store, when put into the dough for
bread, grow and form gas.
This pushes the bits of
dough apart and makes it
light. The little alcohol
formed is all driven off in
the baking.</p>

<p>The alcohol which yeast
forms by growing in sweet
cider is in a few weeks
changed to vinegar by
other germs called the
vinegar plants. Sour cider may make those who
use it sick and drunk because it contains alcohol.
Yeast makes wine out of grape juice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>MILK MAY BE A FOOD OR A POISON</h3>

<p><b>Of what Milk is Made.</b>&mdash;Milk is the most perfect
food known. It contains everything needed to build
and strengthen the body. In one gallon of milk
there is about one teacupful of pure fat, nearly the
same amount of sugar, one teacupful of body-building
food needed to make muscle and blood. There is also
some lime and other mineral matter to make the
bones of the young grow strong. The remaining
seven pints are water.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Milk.</b>&mdash;When milk is left standing in a jar
for several hours, much of the fat, which is present in
the form of tiny balls, rises to the upper part. This
upper layer of milk full of fat is called <i>cream</i>. If
this is removed, the rest is called <i>skim milk</i>.</p>

<p>Milk after standing in a warm place one or two
days becomes sour. It is then sometimes put into a
tight box or barrel and beat in such a way as to break
up the little balls of fat. These are then pressed together
into a mass called <i>butter</i>. It requires a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
gallon of milk to make one teacupful of butter. The
milk remaining after the butter is taken out is called
<i>buttermilk</i>. Cheese is made from milk.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 20</span>
&mdash;Two kinds of milk, showing the amount of fat in each.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Milk as a Food.</b>&mdash;Milk is a healthful drink for
nearly every one and especially useful for those with
weak bodies. During sickness it is sometimes the
only food the patient can take. It is well for children
to use two or three glasses of milk daily with their
meals. It should be sipped slowly so it will mix with
the fluid in the mouth and not form lumps called
curds in the stomach.</p>

<p>A quart of milk contains more food for the body
than a half pound of good beefsteak. A pint of milk
will supply the body with about as much food as a
pint of oysters. A bowl of milk and a half loaf of
bread is a healthful supper for a boy or girl. Skim
milk and buttermilk are healthful drinks which
furnish much food for building bone, blood, and
muscle.</p>

&mdash;Germs which grow in milk and make it sour.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><b>When Milk is a Poison.</b>&mdash;In New York, Cincinnati,
and Chicago it has been noticed for many years that
large numbers of babies become sick in warm weather
and many of them die.
The doctors learned
that most of the babies
taken sick were being
fed on cows' milk
because their own
mothers did not have
enough for them. It
was then found that
the sick babies had
been using milk from
dairies where the
stables were dirty, the cows soiled, and the hands of
the milkers unclean. On this account much dirt got
into the milk.</p>

<p>Babies fed on clean milk from clean cows kept in
clean stables remained strong and well. By much
study the doctors learned that <i>dirty milk is poisonous
milk</i>. The poison is made by the germs or bacteria
living by the millions in unclean stables and in milk
buckets not well washed in boiling water. Dirty milk
becomes most poisonous in hot weather because warmth
makes the germs grow very fast and become so numerous
that millions are present in a teaspoonful of milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><b>Keeping Milk Clean.</b>&mdash;During one week of hot
weather in Cincinnati, over a hundred babies were
poisoned with dirty milk. In the same week twice
this number were made sick by unclean milk in Philadelphia.
During the hot part of the year in our
country bad milk kills more than a half dozen babies
every hour of the day and night.</p>

<p>The only way <i>to have milk clean is to have clean
stables with clean cows, milked by clean hands, and the
milk handled in clean pails, cans, and bottles which have
been scalded after being washed</i>. The milk must then
be kept cold until used, so that the germs will not
grow in it.</p>

<p><b>Saving the Baby from Bad Milk.</b>&mdash;If possible, milk
should be bought for the baby in bottles sealed with
a pasteboard lid. If milk turns sour the same day
it is delivered, it is not fit for the baby to take.
Heating it makes most milk safer for use. The
heating of milk to kill most of the germs is <i>pasteurizing</i>
it. It should be kept very hot for about
fifteen minutes, but should not be allowed to boil.
It should be cooled by placing the vessel on ice or in
cold water.</p>

<p>The baby's bottle and nipple should be washed in
cold water and then well scalded immediately after
being used. The bottle, the nipple, and the milk
should be kept away from flies and dust. One fly has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
been known to carry on its body more germs than
there are leaves on a large tree.</p>

cells the flies brought typhoid germs from the sewer and made the prisoners
sick with fever.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Flies and Fever in a Prison.</b>&mdash;In August, 1908,
thirteen prisoners in the jail at Easton, Pennsylvania,
were taken ill with typhoid fever. They had not been
near any sick persons and their food and water were
found to be pure. All those sick were in cells in one
end of the prison. About twenty feet from this end
a sewer had been uncovered two weeks before and
left open. This sewer carried the waste from the
hospital where several patients were sick with the
fever. Flies fed on the waste in the sewer and then
with the germs sticking to their feet flew into the
cells of the prisoners and walked over their cups,
spoons, and food. A little girl who played near
this open sewer and shared her lunch with the flies
had a severe attack of fever two weeks later because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the germs scraped from the flies' feet on her food got
into her body and grew.</p>

<p><b>Milk and Disease.</b>&mdash;We must be very careful to
get not only clean milk but milk from healthy cows
milked by persons who have no typhoid fever, scarlet
fever, or diphtheria in their homes. If only one or
two disease germs get into the milk from the hands
of those who have nursed the sick, these will grow
into immense numbers in a single day. Many of
those who use the milk will then become ill. Hundreds
are made sick in this way every year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>HOW THE BODY USES FOOD</h3>

<p><b>Organs for making ready the Food.</b>&mdash;Before the
food can get into the blood and be carried over the
body to feed the muscles and the brain, it must be
made into a fluid. This changing of the solid food
into a liquid by the stomach and other organs is called
<i>digestion</i>. The organs which do this work are known
as <i>digestive organs</i>. They consist of a <i>food tube</i> and
several bodies called <i>glands</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Food Tube.</b>&mdash;The food canal is about thirty
feet long. Its first part, the <i>mouth</i>, opens back of the
tongue into the throat, named the <i>pharynx</i>. This
leads into a tube, the gullet, passing down through
the back part of the chest into the <i>stomach</i> below the
diaphragm. The stomach is a bent sac opening into
a tube over twenty-five feet long called the <i>bowels</i> or
<i>intestines</i>. This tube is folded into a bunch which
fills a large part of the cavity of the abdomen.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i047" id="i047"></a>
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="150" height="186" alt="A Gland" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 23</span>
&mdash;The plan of a gland. <i>a</i> carries blood to the gland and <i>v</i> takes it away
after the gland has taken out what it needs. On the right side the top of
the gland has been cut off.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Glands or Juice Makers.</b>&mdash;A gland is a little
tube closed at one end, or a bunch of such tubes, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
can take something out of the blood and make
it into a juice. A gland under each ear and four
others near the tongue
make the juice called
<i>saliva</i> which flows into
the mouth through
tubes.</p>

<p>A long, flat, pink
gland back of the
stomach is called the
<i>sweetbread</i> or <i>pancreas</i>.
This and a large brown
gland, the <i>liver</i>, empty
their juices into the
intestines. The whole
inner surface of the
stomach and intestines
is lined with tiny tubes,
the glands. The juice of these with that of the other
glands softens the food and makes it into a liquid.</p>

<p><b>The Work of the Mouth.</b>&mdash;The mouth has three
things to do: It should break the lumps of food
into fine bits so it can be well wet with the slippery
fluid called <i>saliva</i> and also easily swallowed. It
must roll the food about so that it gets soaked with
saliva. It must hold the food long enough to get
much taste from it because this starts the juices to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
flowing into the stomach. Food gives out its taste
only after it is changed to a liquid. It should not be
washed down with water, as this weakens the juices
in the stomach.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 24</span>
&mdash;The three glands which make the saliva for acting on the food in the mouth.</p>
</div>

<p>No food should be swallowed until it is broken
into bits nearly as small as the head of a pin. Some
foods, such as cheese, bananas, and nuts, should be
made even finer than this. There is nothing in the
stomach to crush to pieces large lumps of food. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
juices of the stomach can do their full work only
when the food is well chewed in the mouth.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i049" id="i049"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 25</span>
&mdash;Photograph of a chestnut chewed a half minute by a boy who
had poor teeth because he had not taken care of them. The lumps
are so large that the juices of the stomach could not dissolve them.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Chewing of Food keeps away Sickness.</b>&mdash;Bread,
meat, and potatoes should be cut into pieces no larger
than half the size of your
thumb and each piece
put separately into your
mouth with a fork. It
should then be chewed
from twenty to thirty
times before another piece
is put into the mouth.
Food treated in this way
will not cause headache
or a sickness in the
stomach called <i>indigestion</i>
or <i>dyspepsia</i>. It is
said that there are so many persons with this kind of
sickness that more than $5,000,000 are spent every
year for medicine to help them.</p>

<p>Too little chewing of the food while you are young
may not cause many aches or pains, but if you form
the habit of rapid eating it is hard to learn to eat
slowly. No one who chews his food poorly can avoid
sickness long or grow well and strong.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 26</span>
&mdash;Photograph of a chestnut chewed a half minute by a boy with good teeth.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Work of the Stomach.</b>&mdash;When the food is swallowed,
it passes through the gullet into the stomach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
This is a sac holding more than a quart (<a href="#i052">Fig. 27</a>).
It is made of an outer wall of muscle and an inner
skinlike coat full of tiny tubes called <i>gastric glands</i>.
Millions of these give
out drop by drop a watery
fluid named <i>gastric juice</i>.
This juice begins to flow
as soon as we smell or
taste food and continues
to drop out as long as
there is any food in the
stomach.</p>

<p>The use of the gastric
juice is to help change
part of the food into a more watery fluid. To do this
it must be well mixed with the food. This mixing is
done by the muscles in the outer wall of the stomach
(<a href="#i057">Fig. 29</a>). They squeeze together and then loosen up
in such a way as to move the food about and turn it
over until every particle is wet again and again with
the gastric juice.</p>

<p><b>How long Food stays in the Stomach.</b>&mdash;A ring of
muscle around the end of the stomach keeps the food
from escaping until it has become a thin grayish
liquid. The stomach can finish its work on some
kinds of food in one or two hours. With other
foods it must work four or five hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]<br />[Pg 53]</a></span>The stomach can finish its work on soft boiled
eggs, milk, roasted potatoes, and broiled lamb within
two hours. With pork, veal, cabbage, and fried potatoes
it must work four or five hours. When a person
is sick the stomach is weak, and he should have only
the food which causes the stomach the least work.</p>

<p><b>The Work of the Intestines.</b>&mdash;The last part of the
work in getting the food ready for the blood is done in
the long folded tube known as the intestine (<a href="#i052">Fig. 27</a>).
Here juices coming from the pancreas and liver mix
with the food and change into a liquid those parts
not acted on in the stomach.</p>

<p>The intestine does quite as much work as the stomach.
Sometimes when the stomach is sick, too much
work is put off on the intestines and then they become
sick and give much pain.</p>

<p>The pint of watery fluid from the pancreas and the
quart of greenish yellow fluid called <i>bile</i> given out by
the liver are carried through two tubes into the intestine
(<a href="#i052">Fig. 27</a>). To mix these juices with the food
the intestine is being swung gently back and forth
and the walls squeezed together by muscles forming
its outer coat. As soon as the intestine has finished
its work the food begins to enter the blood.</p>

&mdash;Showing how the food in the dog is carried from the intestine to the liver
and heart. The white tubes carry the fats up to the vein in the neck, and the
dark tubes which are veins carry the other part of the food to the liver.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How Food gets into the Blood.</b>&mdash;An hour or two
after food has entered the intestine it is almost as
thin a fluid as milk. Millions of tiny fingerlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
growths stick out from the inner side of the intestines
and drink in the watery food. These little fingers
for drinking up the
food are scarcely one
fourth as large as the
point of a pencil.
They are called <i>villi</i>.</p>

<p>The villi are filled
with blood tubes having
thin walls. The
food passes through
these walls into the
blood stream. Much
of it then goes to the
liver, but the fatty
parts flow up a tube
along the backbone
and empty into a
blood tube in the neck.
From the neck and
the liver the food goes
with the blood to the
heart which sends it
to all parts of the
body.</p>

<p><b>What the Liver does.</b>&mdash;The liver is a dark red body
nearly as large as the upper half of your head. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
lies just below the diaphragm. It works night and
day helping to keep the inner parts of the body clean
and at the same time deal out food.</p>

<p>The liver takes some waste out of the blood and
sends it out into the intestine with the bile. When
there is no food in the intestine, the bile is stored up
in the <i>gall bladder</i> under the liver. The liver
changes certain waste matter in the blood into such
form that other organs can cast it out of the body.
It also stores up certain parts of the food coming
from the intestines and gives it out to the body little
by little as it is needed.</p>

<p><b>When and How much to Eat.</b>&mdash;When the food
organs do not do their work rightly, the whole body
becomes sick. Eating too much overworks the
stomach. It becomes so full that the food cannot
be moved about and well mixed with the juices.
Germs then work on the food and make it sour. In
fact the germs may change part of the food into a
poison. This poison will cause headache and a bad
feeling.</p>

<p>Do not form a habit of taking powders to cure headache.
They are likely to hurt the heart. Take less
food, eat it more slowly, and do not wash it down
with drink. Stop eating before your stomach feels full.</p>

<p>Each meal gives the stomach about four hours of
work to do. It then needs one hour of rest. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
shows that the time from one meal to the next should
be about five hours. Very young children and sick persons
need food oftener. Boys and girls should not
eat candies, cake, or other food between meals. It
spoils the appetite and is likely to get the stomach
out of working order.</p>

<p><b>Danger Signals.</b>&mdash;A white or yellowish coat on the
tongue, a bad breath, pain in the bowels, or a headache
is a danger signal. It tells that the food organs
are not doing their work as they should and unless
help is given sickness is likely to occur. Medicine
may help, but using foods easy to digest, eating less,
chewing more, and getting plenty of exercise in the
fresh air are likely to be the greatest aids to health.</p>

<p><b>The Chewing of Tobacco and Digestion.</b>&mdash;Some men
chew tobacco as much as ten hours every day. The
taste of the tobacco makes the saliva flow from the
glands into the mouth. This dissolves the poison out
of the tobacco and it is then spit out. If the tobacco-soaked
saliva were all swallowed, the man would be
poisoned.</p>

<p>The chewing of tobacco causes the loss of much
saliva which is needed to help digest the food. Anyone
who tires his jaw by chewing tobacco is not likely
to chew his food well. Some of the poison in the
tobacco is taken into the body through the blood vessels
in the lining of the mouth. This is shown by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the fact that a boy not used to tobacco becomes very
sick after he has chewed a mouthful for only ten
minutes.</p>

<p><b>Smoking and Digestion.</b>&mdash;Some persons think that
the smoking of a cigar after a meal helps digestion.
It may do so in some cases. If a lawyer is much
excited about a case he is trying, or a business man
is in trouble about his losses, the thinking causes the
blood to flow to the head when it is needed in the
stomach to give out digestive juices.</p>

<p>The taste of the tobacco smoke may cause some
gastric juice to run out into the stomach, but at the
same time it is likely to hurt the nerves of taste so
that food cannot give so much enjoyment as when
the nerves are unharmed. Although smoking may
at the time help digestion a little, the poison in the
tobacco may afterward injure the body. This poison
is especially harmful to growing bodies, and boys who
are wise will refuse to smoke on all occasions.</p>

<p><b>Beer and Digestion.</b>&mdash;Some people drink beer with
their meals because they think it makes the food
taste better. It really prevents them from getting
the full taste of the food because they wash it down
before it is well soaked with the saliva.</p>

&mdash;The stomach, showing the arrangement of the muscular fibers which alcohol may

</div>

<p>The flavor of beer may sometimes cause an extra
flow of gastric juice into the stomach, but the alcohol
in the beer is likely to make the movements of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
stomach slower. This prevents the food from being
well and quickly mixed with the juices. Several
glasses of beer used at one meal
will make the stomach do its
work very slowly, and it will not
do it well.</p>

<p><b>Wine and Digestion.</b>&mdash;Wine
is taken by some
people to give
more appetite for
food. It is likely,
however, to do
more harm than
good because the alcohol in it makes the muscles
which mix the food in the stomach act more slowly.
Some of the food may sour before it gets wet with the
juice. Much wine used at a meal is always harmful.</p>

<p><b>Natural Appetite.</b>&mdash;If one is in health, he should
feel a desire for his food at every meal. This desire
for a reasonable amount of food is a natural appetite.
Fresh air and exercise will do much to give one the
right kind of an appetite. The eating of much sweets
and the breathing of bad air are likely to spoil the
appetite.</p>

<p>The use of some things, such as opium, tobacco,
beer, wine, and whisky, creates an unnatural appetite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
That is, after one has used these articles a few months
he cannot stop their use without great suffering. The
younger the person, the sooner the appetite becomes
fixed. For this reason <i>young persons should never
use tobacco or alcoholic drinks of any kind</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE CARE OF THE MOUTH</h3>

<p><b>Sickness often begins in the Mouth.</b>&mdash;A clean
mouth and sound teeth have much to do in keeping
one well. The germs which cause nearly a half
million deaths in the United States every year enter
the body through the mouth. If the mouth is unclean,
only one or two disease germs entering it may
remain there and grow.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 150px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 30</span>
&mdash;The teeth of the upper jaw at eleven years of age.</p>
</div>

<p>It is just as important to wash the mouth two
or three times each day as it is to wash the hands
and face. A few
germs of diphtheria,
sore throat,
or tuberculosis are
likely to get into
the mouth any
day, but if the
mouth and teeth
are well washed
with a brush morning and night, the germs will not
have time to grow and cause sickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span><b>The Teeth.</b>&mdash;The first twenty teeth that appear
are called the <i>milk set</i>. The eight front teeth grow
out during the first year of life and back of these
twelve others appear during the second year. Between
the seventh and the tenth year all of the milk
teeth are lost because others grow beneath them and
push them out.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i060" id="i060"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 31</span>
&mdash;The full set of teeth on the right side at twelve years of age. The
numbers show at what year of age each one grows out of the gum.</p>
</div>

<p>The first four teeth of the second set appear in the
sixth year, just behind the last milk teeth (<a href="#i059">Fig. 30</a>).
These teeth should be watched very closely and at
the first sign of decay you should go to the dentist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
As the milk teeth get loose and come out, the second
set of teeth take their places.</p>

<p>If you are ten or eleven years old, you should
have twelve good teeth in the upper jaw and the
same number below. The last ones to break through
the gums are the four wisdom teeth at the back of
the mouth. They appear after the seventeenth year.</p>

<p>The front teeth are called <i>incisors</i> because they are
used to cut the food. The back teeth are named
<i>molars</i> because they are used in grinding the food.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 32</span>
&mdash;Photograph of teeth not kept clean, showing how germs and a
sour substance called acid eat holes in them and thus cause decay and toothache.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Toothache.</b>&mdash;Toothache is a common ailment, and
yet it can be entirely prevented. A tooth does not
ache until it has a hole in it. The tender nerve
within gives us warning that it is being hurt. The
dentist can stop the ache and mend the tooth so that
it will not ache again. Look at your teeth every
month and feel about them with a wooden tooth-pick
to know when the decay begins. If the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
holes are mended as soon as found, you will never
have toothache, and you can keep your teeth as
long as you live.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i062" id="i062"></a>
<img src="images/i062.jpg" width="150" height="274" alt="A tooth" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 33</span>
&mdash;Slice down through a tooth showing <i>f</i>, the enamel, and <i>d</i>, the
soft pulp with nerves and blood tubes from the root at <i>h</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How to keep the Teeth Sound.</b>&mdash;Every tooth is
covered with a layer of hard shining substance
called <i>enamel</i> (<a href="#i062">Fig. 33</a>). So long as
this is unbroken the softer bony
part of the tooth cannot decay. At
the base of the tooth where the gum
joins it the enamel is very thin,
so that the scratch of a pin or other
instrument may break it.</p>

<p>Never pick the teeth with a pin
or needle. The biting off of thread,
finger nails, and other hard material
may crack the enamel. It may also
be softened and eaten away by acid
formed where food remains about
a tooth. For this reason a quill or
wooden pick or piece of tough thread,
called <i>dental floss</i>, should be used to clear the teeth
of food after each meal. Slimy matter collects over
the whole surface of the teeth, and is likely to cause
decay in spots unless it is cleaned off night and morning
with brush and water. The chewing of dry crusts
of bread or crackers strengthens the teeth and keeps
off decay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><b>Why Candy and other Sweets cause the Teeth to
Decay.</b>&mdash;A sour substance called acid usually starts
the decay of a tooth by eating through the enamel.
Germs change sugar and other sweets into an acid.
The acid is not made at once. An hour or more is
needed for the germs to grow to form the acid. If,
after eating sweet foods, the mouth is well cleaned,
no acid will be formed. Sugar and candy do not,
therefore, spoil the teeth unless it is left sticking
about them.</p>

<p><b>How to brush the Teeth.</b>&mdash;Every boy and girl
should own a toothbrush. <i>The teeth should be
brushed every night and morning and kept white.</i>
Yellow or gray slimy teeth are very ugly. The
teeth should be brushed on the inside as well as on
the outside. It is best to brush the teeth crosswise
for two minutes and then spend another two minutes
brushing the upper teeth downwards and the lower
teeth upwards. This prevents pushing the gum away
from the teeth. Plenty of water should be used with
the brush, and a little good powder is helpful once a
day.</p>

<p><b>How the Dentist can Help.</b>&mdash;Sometimes the milk
teeth do not get loose so that they can be pulled
with the fingers at the right time. The second teeth
then come in at one side and may never get straight
in place. They then spoil the appearance of the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and do poor work in chewing. The dentist should
be asked to help straighten the teeth as soon as they
appear crooked.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i064" id="i064"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 34</span>
&mdash;Exact drawing of the teeth of two persons. Those in the lower
picture began to decay over twenty-five years ago and they were then
filled so as to remain perfect. The teeth in the upper picture began to
decay less than ten years ago but were not filled.</p>
</div>

<p>It is wise to have the dentist examine the teeth
once or twice every year and remove a limy substance
called tartar collecting at their base. The
dentist can stop the decay in a tooth by cleaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
out the little hole and filling it with gold or some
other material. It may cause a little pain and expense
to have the teeth filled, but it will save a hundred
times as much pain and expense later. The
six year molars need special care as they are likely
to decay early. Even the milk teeth often need filling
so that they will not be lost too soon.</p>

<p><b>Bad Teeth cause Sickness.</b>&mdash;When anything decays,
it is full of germs, and they are always giving off
some poison. The poison may hurt the body and is
likely to make parts of the mouth sore and tender so
that other germs of disease can break through into
the flesh. Disease germs can easily lodge in the holes
of decaying teeth, grow in numbers, and finally cause
diphtheria, sore throat, or other ailments.</p>

<p>Four out of every five children suffering from
diphtheria or other throat or ear troubles are found to
have from one to ten bad teeth. You must keep
good teeth if you wish to be well and strong.</p>

<p><b>The Value of Sound Teeth.</b>&mdash;Sound teeth which will
do good work in chewing food are worth more than a
foot or an arm. If the foot or arm is lost, the body is
likely to get well and be as healthy as ever. <i>The
health of the whole body depends upon the work done
by the teeth.</i> Unless they do their part the stomach
cannot get the food ready for the blood.</p>

<p>A part of badly chewed food is turned into a poison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
farther down in the food canal. This is what makes
many people feel so tired and miserable much of the
time. Hundreds of men have been refused admission
to our army because they have poor teeth. Soldiers
must be strong and well to take long marches and
fight battles. Sound teeth give strength and health.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>ALCOHOLIC DRINKS</h3>

<p><b>Drink needed for Health.</b>&mdash;Water in the form of
sweat and in other ways is constantly passing off
from the body. This water carries with it the waste
matter which, if it remained, would poison the body.
There is some water in the food we eat, but not enough
to supply the wants of the body.</p>

<p>Some persons think that the body needs beer or
wine to keep it in good order. These liquids, as well
as whisky, brandy, and rum, are called <i>alcoholic drinks</i>.
The latest experiments and studies show that the body
never needs alcoholic drinks to keep it in the best
of health. These drinks sometimes make the body
sick, and if much alcohol is taken at one time, the
person becomes dizzy, staggers, and may fall down and
go to sleep.</p>

<p><b>The Desire for Drink.</b>&mdash;When parts of the body
have too little water, there is a longing for drink.
This is called <i>thirst</i>. As soon as a cup of water is
drunk the desire is satisfied. There is no danger of
drinking too much pure water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>Persons who have been accustomed to use alcoholic
drink have a thirst which water does not satisfy. It
is an <i>unnatural thirst</i>. Even beer or wine will not
satisfy such a thirst except for a few minutes. Very
often a person's thirst is not satisfied until he has
used so much wine or whisky that he becomes dull and
unsteady in his walk. He is then said to be drunk.</p>

</div>

<p><b>How the Yeast Plant makes Alcohol.</b>&mdash;In the cake
of yeast bought at the grocery there are millions of
tiny plants, each shaped
somewhat like a potato.
This strange little plant
will grow very rapidly
when put into any
sweet watery substance.
It sends out a bud
which grows larger and
larger until in a half
hour the bud is as large as the old plant. It may
then break loose and grow other buds, just like the
mother plant.</p>

<p>When yeast grows, it changes the sugar or sweet
part of the water into alcohol and a gas called carbon
dioxide. It is this gas which makes beer foam and
bubble when opened. All alcohol used in beer, porter,
ale, wine, brandy, rum, gin, and whisky is made by
yeast plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span><b>How Beer is Made.</b>&mdash;There is more beer used than
any other alcoholic drink. It is cheap and is much
weaker in alcohol than
wine or whisky. Only
about one twentieth
part of beer is alcohol.</p>

</div>

<p>In making beer, a
sweet watery mixture
is first prepared by
mashing sprouted barley
grains in water.
Barley or any other
grain forms sugar as soon as it begins to grow. Yeast
plants are added to the
sweet mixture. By
growing they change
some of the sugar into
alcohol. Hops are also
put in to give the beer
a fine flavor. After a
time the clear liquid is
separated from the barley
grains and hops and
put into tight casks and
bottles.</p>

<p><b>The Making of Wine.</b>&mdash;Wine
contains from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
two to four times as much alcohol as beer. Most
of the wine is made in California, France, and
Germany because grapes grow better in these countries
than elsewhere. Wine may be made from
the juice of any fruit, but the grape is generally
used.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 38</span>
&mdash;The quantity of grapes required to make this glass full of wine.</p>
</div>

<p>The grapes after being picked are thrown into
large tubs and crushed so that the juice runs out.
The wild yeast
always present
on the grape
skins begins
to grow in
the juice and
change some
of the sugar
into alcohol.
This work of
the yeast lasts
from one to
eight weeks. At the end of that time, the grape
juice has become a kind of poor wine, consisting
of alcohol, water, grape flavor, and some acid. To
make the wine good it must be drawn off into casks,
where the yeast causes further changes during several
weeks. It is then put into bottles, where it should
remain about five years to get the right flavor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span><b>Sherry</b> is a strong wine used in flavoring food,
such as puddings and sauces. A few teaspoonfuls of
this wine will make a child drunk. The wines made
at home from elderberries, blackberries, and cherries
contain alcohol which will do just as much harm as
that in the purchased wines.</p>

<p><b>How Brandy is Made.</b>&mdash;Brandy contains more
alcohol than wine and almost as much as whisky.
In fact brandy is only very strong wine. After the
yeast plants have formed as much alcohol as they can
in grape juice it becomes so strong that it kills them.
This wine is then heated in such a way as to separate
some of the water from it. The taking away of the
water leaves the wine stronger in alcohol and it then
forms brandy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span><b>Whisky and Rum.</b>&mdash;These two drinks are strong in
alcohol. Nearly one half of each is pure alcohol.
Whisky is usually
made from rye,
corn, or wheat,
or all three together.
They furnish
the food in
which the yeast
grows and makes
alcohol. This
watery mixture of
grain and alcohol
is then heated
and the vapor
or steam forms
whisky after it
goes off through a pipe into another vessel. This
kind of heating is <i>distillation</i>. Rum is formed in somewhat
the same way from molasses or cane juice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>ALCOHOL AND HEALTH</h3>

<p><b>The Money spent for Alcoholic Drinks.</b>&mdash;If the money
spent for alcoholic drinks were all collected together
in silver dollars, it would more than fill ten schoolrooms
of average size. Not only rich men spend
large sums yearly for fine wines and brandies, but
also the poor give their money for beer and other
drinks which the body does not need.</p>

<p>When parents waste their money on drink, they
cannot buy the food and clothes needed to keep their
families strong and well. In this way strong drink
causes much sickness and suffering and sometimes
even death.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol injures the Body.</b>&mdash;Some persons drink
very little beer or wine, so they seem to have but
little effect on the health. Others use strong drink
every day and for a few years they may remain
quite well. Later ill health often comes on, and they
then find that some of the organs have been so much
hurt that they will never be quite well again.</p>

<p>A few years ago a group of fifty well-known men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
in the United States spent much time and thousands
of dollars to learn how much alcohol was harming
our country. After much study among many
people they announced that there were about one million
men and boys whose health had been injured
by strong drink, such as beer, wine, and whisky. Because
strong drink causes so much sorrow and sickness
several states have passed laws forbidding its
sale, and saloons have been closed by laws in parts of
many other states.</p>

<p><b>How Alcohol affects Kittens.</b>&mdash;The body of a kitten
is made very much like the body of a child. It has
just the same organs that a child has, and they do
the same kind of work. Doctor Hodge, a well-known
scientist of Massachusetts, therefore concluded that
alcohol would act on kittens in the same way as it
would on a man or boy.</p>

<p>The doctor got two healthy kittens and fed them
a little alcohol every day for nearly two weeks. In
a few days they stopped being playful, did not grow,
and did not keep their fur clean and smooth as
healthy kittens do. After using alcohol several days
they became very ill. This experiment showed that
alcohol stops kittens from growing and robs them of
good health.</p>

<p><b>How Alcohol hurts Dogs.</b>&mdash;Doctor Hodge fed a
little alcohol to two dogs nearly every day for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
years. He also kept the brother and sister of these
dogs, but gave them no alcohol. All the dogs had
the same kind of food and were treated alike except
that one pair got alcohol and the other pair did not.</p>

<p>The two drinking dogs got sick more easily and
staid sick much longer than the temperance dogs.
The drinking dogs became lazy, and timid, while the
others were strong, full of fun, and brave.</p>

<p>Within four years the drinking dogs had born to
them twenty-seven puppies, but only four of them
lived to grow up. The others were too weak or
sickly to live. During the same time the temperance
dogs had forty-five puppies and forty-one of these
lived. This shows that strong drink will not only
injure the bodies of those who take it, but will make
their children weak and sickly.</p>

<p><b>The Use of Strong Drink causes Disease.</b>&mdash;Many
persons who take beer or wine every day become fat.
They think this is a sign of health. It is really a
sign of disease. They become short of breath. They
can no longer run so fast or do so much work because
the heart is covered with fat and even some
of its wall is changed to fat. For this reason the
heart cannot do its work easily or well.</p>

<p>The kidneys which take the waste out of the blood
often become injured by alcohol and a disease causing
death follows. Sometimes the stomach becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
diseased so that it cannot do its work. This makes
the whole body sick.</p>

<p>The hardening of parts of the liver is nearly
always caused by the use of beer. The liver is sure
to suffer if one uses much alcoholic drink because the
alcohol goes direct from the food tube to the liver.
Long use of strong drink may bring on disease in the
brain and nerves.</p>

<p><b>Alcoholic Drinks may cause Death.</b>&mdash;Every ten
years the government appoints persons to visit each
home in our land to take the census. A part of this
census report consists of a table showing the disease
of which people died. It is from the census report
that we know that hundreds of people die every year
from the use of alcohol.</p>

<p><b>Danger to Health in beginning the Use of Strong
Drink.</b>&mdash;A large number of people take a drink of
beer or wine occasionally because they do not see
that it hurts the body. No one expects to become a
steady drinker or a drunkard when he begins to
drink. Reports show that every drunkard begins his
downward course by taking a few drinks occasionally.
Thousands of persons begin a drunkard's life every
year because the appetite leads them on gently until
they become slaves and cannot let drink alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>TOBACCO AND OTHER DRUGS WHICH INJURE THE<br />
HEALTH</h3>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i077" id="i077"></a>
<img src="images/i077.jpg" width="150" height="375" alt="Tobacco" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 41</span>
&mdash;The tobacco plant.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How Tobacco is Made.</b>&mdash;Tobacco is made from the
leaves of the tobacco plant. The plant may grow as
tall as a man and bear more than a
dozen leaves. Each leaf is two or
three times as large as your hand.
The seeds are planted in the springtime,
and the plants are ready to be
cut in the autumn. Most of our
tobacco is raised in the Southern
states and Cuba.</p>

<p>After cutting, the tobacco must be
dried and cared for in a special way
to give it the right flavor. It is then
sent to factories and made into cigars,
smoking tobacco, or chewing tobacco.</p>

<p><b>How Tobacco is Used.</b>&mdash;Many million
dollars are spent every year by
the people of our country for tobacco. Most of the
tobacco is used in smoking. Some men smoke it in
pipes, while others smoke it in the form of cigars or
cigarettes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Many men chew tobacco. When used in this way,
something like licorice is generally mixed with the
tobacco to give it a more pleasant taste. Sometimes
the dry tobacco is ground into a fine powder called
snuff. This is used by both men and women.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco contains a Poison.</b>&mdash;When boys chew or
smoke tobacco for the first time, it always makes
them sick. Chewing or smoking for fifteen minutes
will make them grow dizzy and weak and feel so
sick that they must lie down for a long time.</p>

<p>The sickness is caused by a poison called <i>nicotine</i>
which is present in all tobacco. Much of this poison
may be soaked out by boiling the tobacco in water.
A cup of water in which a pipeful of tobacco has
been boiled will kill goldfish in an hour when poured
into a gallon jar of water with the fish. There is
enough poison in a handful of tobacco to kill a boy
who is not in the habit of using it.</p>

<p><b>Why Men can use Tobacco without becoming Sick.</b>&mdash;Experiments
upon animals have shown that the body
can learn to use a poison and not become sick from
it. The poison of a rattlesnake is deadly to most
animals; but if a tiny bit of the poison is put under
the skin of the rabbit one day and then on each
succeeding day a little larger dose of the poison is
given the rabbit for a long time, the animal will
become so accustomed to the poison that the bite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
a rattlesnake will not harm it. It is the same way
with tobacco. Little by little the body learns to
overcome the effects of the poison, but much use of
tobacco is likely to hurt certain parts of the body.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco is Harmful to the Young.</b>&mdash;A dose of poison
which will kill a child may do but little harm to
a man. Tobacco is certain to hurt boys more than
it does men. The poison makes the body grow
slower.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i079" id="i079"></a>
<img src="images/i079.jpg" width="500" height="222" alt="Poison" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 42</span>
&mdash;There is more poison in the one on the right than in the one on the left.</p>
</div>

<p>A large number of measurements made by Doctor
Seaver showed that the boys who did not use tobacco
gained in four years one twentieth more in weight
and one fourth more in girth and height than the
users of tobacco. These boys were between sixteen
and twenty-two years of age. It is likely that tobacco
will have a more harmful effect on younger boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span><b>Laws to keep the Young Healthy.</b>&mdash;Boys ought to
be wise and brave enough to let alone what keeps
their bodies from growing and hurts their health,
but some will not do it. For this reason some
countries are trying to save the health of their boys
by making laws against the use of tobacco.</p>

<p>The Germans a few years ago passed a law in their
land forbidding all boys and girls under sixteen
years of age to use tobacco in any form. Seeing the
good results of this law in Germany and the harm
that tobacco was doing the boys in the United States,
the Emperor of Japan on the 6th of March, 1900,
proclaimed this law: "The smoking of tobacco by
minors under the age of twenty is prohibited."</p>

<p>In our own country several states have passed laws
against the use of cigarettes by boys. One country
after another is learning that if they want strong
men, to fight, to work, and to win, tobacco must not
be allowed to weaken the bodies of the young.</p>

<p><b>How the White Man becomes a Slave.</b>&mdash;Before the
Civil War the black men of the South were slaves.
They could not do as they pleased because they
belonged to their masters whom they must obey
or else they would suffer punishment. No boy can
begin the use of tobacco without the danger of becoming
a slave to it.</p>

<p>The use of tobacco either by chewing or smoking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
gradually causes in any one the growth of an appetite
which makes him feel miserable and unhappy unless
it is kept satisfied. It can be satisfied only by the
use of more and more tobacco.</p>

<p>Many men would like to quit the use of tobacco if
they could do so without suffering. They are slaves,
and tobacco is their master.</p>

<p><b>Cigarettes and Health.</b>&mdash;A cigarette is a tube of
paper filled with tobacco. The tobacco is usually not
so strong as that used in cigars and pipes. For this
reason, boys like it better, and because it is so mild
they draw the smoke down into the lungs. This
gives the poison a better chance to be taken up by
the blood. On this account, and because one is likely
to smoke oftener when he smokes a small piece of tobacco,
cigarettes are thought by some to be more
harmful than the use of tobacco in pipes and cigars.</p>

<p><b>Tea and Coffee.</b>&mdash;Tea is made from the dried leaves
of the tea plant. Tea plants are raised in North Carolina,
China, and Japan. The drink called tea used
at the table is made by pouring boiling water on the
tea leaves. The leaves should not be boiled as this
draws out a substance which keeps the stomach from
doing its work in the right way.</p>

<p>Coffee is the seed of a plant growing in South
America and Asia. It is roasted, then ground, and
boiled in water to make the drink called coffee.</p>

&mdash;Branch of a tea plant.&mdash;Branch of a coffee plant
with bunches of coffee berries near the bottom.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>Children should not use either tea or coffee as they
are likely to hurt the stomach and may injure the
heart. One or two cups of tea or coffee daily seem
to have little or no bad effect on the health of most
grown persons. Coffee taken at supper may keep
one awake by sending too much blood to the brain.</p>

<p><b>Opium and Morphine.</b>&mdash;Opium is a dangerous drug
which is got from the heads of the white poppy plant
grown mostly in the far East. From gashes cut in
the poppy heads a juice runs out and hardens into a
gum from which the pure drug is made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Some persons smoke opium for the drowsy and
pleasant feeling it gives. Its use is very hurtful and
ruins both body and mind. <i>Morphine</i> is a pure form
of opium. Persons take it to kill pain and make
them sleep. You should never take it except when
given by the doctor, as a habit is quickly formed
which will make you miserable through life.</p>

<p><b>Patent Medicines.</b>&mdash;These are medicines advertised
to cure ailments which generally cannot be cured by
drugs. They are the medicines much advertised in
the newspapers and magazines. Never use them unless
your doctor tells you to do so. Many of them
contain harmful drugs, such as morphine and alcohol.
When you are sick, go to your doctor for advice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE SKIN AND BATHING</h3>

<p><b>Parts of the Skin.</b>&mdash;The skin is about as thick as
the leather of your shoe. It is fastened to the
muscles beneath with fine white threads like spider
webs. This is called <i>connective tissue</i> because it connects
the skin to the lean meat.</p>

<p>The skin is made of two layers (<a href="#i085">Fig. 45</a>). The
upper layer is formed of cells. This is named <i>epidermis</i>
or <i>scarfskin</i>. The deeper layer is made largely of
fine threads woven together. It is the <i>true skin</i> or
<i>derma</i>. There is no blood in the scarfskin, but there
is a network of blood tubes in the true skin. It is
the crowding of these with blood that makes the
skin look so red when we get hot or excited.</p>

<p><b>The Use of the Skin.</b>&mdash;The skin has three chief uses.
It protects the softer parts of the body from being
hurt by rough or hard things which might touch it.
It contains the organs of feeling. It helps keep the
right amount of heat in the body.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i085" id="i085"></a>
<img src="images/i085.jpg" width="150" height="159" alt="View below the skin" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 45</span>
&mdash;A thin slice through the skin, showing sweat glands, a nerve, and
blood-tubes. Much enlarged.</p>
</div>

<p>The top part of the skin is dry and dead. This
gives better protection than if it were moist and tender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Particles of it are wearing out and dropping off
while other bits are growing beneath to take the place
of the worn-out parts.
The more this top
skin is pressed on
and rubbed, the thicker
it becomes. For this
reason it is twice as
thick in the palms of
the hand and on the
soles of the feet.</p>

<p>Scattered through
the true skin are millions
of tiny organs
fastened to the ends of
the nerve threads leading to the spinal cord and brain.
These organs tell us when the skin is touched or when
it is hot or cold or is being hurt.</p>

<p><b>The Pores and the Sweat Glands.</b>&mdash;On a warm day
the skin becomes wet with a salty fluid called <i>sweat</i>
or <i>perspiration</i>. This flows from the tiny holes or
pores in the skin. A good magnifying glass will
show these pores arranged in rows on the ridges in
the palm of the hand.</p>

<p>From each pore a tube leads down into the true skin
to a coiled tube forming the <i>sweat gland</i> (<a href="#i085">Fig. 45</a>).
Sweat glands are present by the thousands in the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of all parts of the body. They give out from one pint
to a gallon of sweat daily. The more we work and
the warmer the weather, the more the sweat flows.</p>

<p>There is a little waste matter carried out of the
body by the sweat, but its chief use is to cool the
body. It does this by passing off in the air and
carrying the heat with it. In this way the body is
kept from getting too hot in summer.</p>

<p><b>The Color of the Skin.</b>&mdash;In the African race the
color of the skin is black, in the Chinese it is yellowish,
while in our race it is nearly white. The different
hues are due to a coloring matter called <i>pigment</i>.
This lies in the deep part of the scarfskin. Going out
in the wind and sun causes more pigment to collect,
and we say we are tanned. If the pigment collects
in spots, it makes freckles.</p>

<p>There is no way of removing at once freckles or
tan. They usually disappear in the winter. No
powders nor any other kind of medicine should be
taken to make the skin white and smooth. Such
medicines may contain poison and are likely in time
to hurt the body. The skin may usually be kept soft
and smooth by washing well with soft water and good
soap. If it becomes harsh or cracked, a little glycerine
rubbed on after each washing may help it.</p>

<p><b>The Nails and their Care.</b>&mdash;The nails are hardened
parts of the epidermis. They are intended to prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the ends of the fingers from being hurt and to
give a neat appearance to the hand.</p>

<p>The ends of the nails should never be chewed or
torn off, as this makes the fingers blunt and the flesh
sore. They should be filed or cut neatly with the
scissors so that they do not stick out beyond the ends
of the fingers.</p>

&mdash;Photograph of hands showing at the right how the nails should
appear, and at the left how biting off the nails makes the fingers blunt and sore.</p>
</div>

<p>Many boys and some girls spoil the appearance of
their nails by letting a line of black dirt remain beneath
them. A piece of a stick or a nail cleaner
should be passed beneath the nails every time the hands
are washed. If the fingers are much soiled, a stiff
brush is useful in removing the dirt under the nails.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">

<img src="images/i088.jpg" width="150" height="229" alt="Hair" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 47</span>
&mdash;A slice through a hair in its sac. Much enlarged.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Hair.</b>&mdash;Some hair grows on nearly all parts of
the body. It is much thicker on the head than elsewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Each hair grows from a little knob at the
bottom of a tiny tube in the skin called the <i>hair sac</i>
(<a href="#i088">Fig. 47</a>). If hair is pulled out, another one will
grow in its place if the knob
at the bottom of the sac is
not hurt.</p>

<p>One or two <i>oil glands</i> open
into each hair sac and give
out an oil to keep the scalp
and hair soft. No other hair
dressing is needed.</p>

<p>After thirty or forty years
of age the hair begins to turn
gray. No medicine will prevent
the hair from turning
gray, and it is generally unwise
to color the hair with a dye. There is poison in
some of the mixtures sold to color the hair.</p>

<p><b>The Care of the Hair.</b>&mdash;When the hair is uncombed,
the whole person looks untidy. The hair should be
combed carefully every morning and again made tidy
before each meal. You should use as little water as
possible to moisten the hair. The glands can be made
to give out their hair oil by squeezing parts of the
scalp between the fingers.</p>

<p>The scalp should be well cleansed with soap and
warm water every three or four weeks. The hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
should be dried quickly with a soft towel and by sitting
in the sun or near a stove. One is likely to
catch cold by going out of doors when the hair is wet.
Hair oils and dandruff cures should not be used unless
advised by a physician. Pinching and wrinkling the
scalp twice weekly with the fingers makes the blood
tubes grow larger and bring more food to the hair.
It will also in many persons stop the hair from falling
out and prevent dandruff and itching.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 48</span>
&mdash;Photographs showing how keeping the hair tidy improves the appearance.</p>
</div>

<p>Do not use the hair brush of another person or exchange
hats with your companions. Unclean persons
and those living or playing much with them often have
among their hairs little creatures called <i>head lice</i>.
They suck blood and cause constant itching. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
doctor will tell any one how to get rid of them
easily.</p>

<p><b>Keeping the Skin <a name="Clean" id="Clean"></a>Clean.</b>&mdash;The amount of dead matter
carried out by the sweat on to the skin every day
is equal to a mass as large as your thumb. Dust also
works through the clothing and sticks fast to the
moist skin. For this reason every one should wash
the whole body once or twice each week. The feet
should be washed oftener as they become more soiled.</p>

<p>Many persons take a bath every day. A cold bath
taken just after rising in the morning wakes up the
nerves, makes the heart work better, and gives health
and strength to the whole body. Afterward, the body
should be well rubbed with a coarse towel. The bath
may be taken by lying in a tub of water or by rubbing
the body over quickly with a wet sponge. A
hot bath is best for cleansing the skin. A warm bath
makes one sleepy and should, therefore, be taken only
at bedtime.</p>

<p><i>The hands should always be well washed before
handling food.</i> Persons neglecting to do this have
caused much sickness because of the disease germs on
their hands. One hundred and fifty persons were
given typhoid fever in one city in Massachusetts by
a man who handled milk without washing his hands.
Dirt and disease are companions. You must be clean
if you would be healthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span><b>The Kidneys.</b>&mdash;The sweat glands do not take out
of the blood one quarter as much waste matter as the
kidneys. These are two bodies longer than the finger
and more than twice as wide, and having the shape
of a bean. One lies on either side of the backbone
below the liver.</p>

<p>The blood coming to the kidneys is full of waste
and dead matter picked up from all parts of the body.
This is passed out through the thin walls of the
thousands of little blood tubes into the many tiny
tubes of the kidneys.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 150px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 49</span>
&mdash;The blood tubes in a piece of skin as large as the head of a pin.</p>
</div>

<p>Water is required to keep the body clean within as
well as without. For this reason you should drink
more than a quart of
water daily. A glass
or two of water drunk
a half hour before
meals cleanses and
rouses to action the
digestive organs.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol and the
Skin.</b>&mdash;The skin of
those who use much
beer or whisky often
becomes rough, red, and pimply. Any alcoholic drink
is likely to injure the skin because it may hinder good
digestion. The drunkard has a red nose and a dark-colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
skin. This is because alcohol weakens the
walls of the blood tubes and lets them become gorged
with blood.</p>

<p>If a person takes a drink only once in a while, his
face becomes red after each drink, and an hour or two
later the effect of the alcohol passes off. The blood
tubes have squeezed up to their natural size.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol and the Kidneys.</b>&mdash;Taking several glasses
daily of even such weak alcoholic drink as beer often
causes the kidneys to become sick. Some of their
working parts become changed to fat and some parts
become hard. The cells which let the waste matter
pass out of the blood get hurt by the poison of the
alcohol so that they let some of the food also pass
out of the blood.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>CLOTHING AND HOW TO USE IT</h3>


<p><b>Kinds of Clothing.</b>&mdash;People are beginning to learn
that the wearing of the right kind of clothing has
much to do with keeping them well. Many persons
wear too heavy clothing in winter. Keeping the
body too hot makes it weak.</p>

<p>Some kinds of clothing are much warmer than
others. Some are expensive and others are cheap.
Cheap clothes will often serve the same purpose as the
more costly ones. If you look at your handkerchief or
stockings, you will see that they are made of threads
running crosswise to each other. All clothing is made
from threads. Some of these are wool, some are linen,
a few are silk, and many are cotton.</p>

<p><b>Woolen Clothing.</b>&mdash;Woolen clothing, such as overcoats
and fine cloth dresses and suits, is made from
the wool cut from sheep. Enough wool can be sheared
from two sheep in one year to make an entire suit of
clothes. The raw wool is first twisted into threads
and then woven by machines into cloth.</p>

&mdash;At the left is a bunch of flax gathered from the field, and on the right is a spool of
thread made from the flax and ready to be woven into linen.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span><b>Linen.</b>&mdash;Linen is used in making collars, cuffs, and
handkerchiefs. It is made from fine threads taken
from the flax plant. On a piece of ground as large
as a schoolroom
enough flax can
be raised to make
a half dozen collars.
Garments to
be worn in warm
weather are sometimes
made of
linen.</p>

<p><b>Silk.</b>&mdash;Silk is
used in making neckties, gloves, ribbons, and dresses.
Silk cloth is woven from the cocoons made by silkworms.
A silkworm is about as big as your largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
finger. It grows to this size from the egg in one
month. In three or four days it spins a shell of silk
thread completely surrounding itself. This shell is
called a <i>cocoon</i>. Within this it changes to a moth.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 52</span>
&mdash;These fibers from the lint about the seed of cotton are woven into cotton cloth.</p>
</div>

<p>When the cocoons are to be used for silk, the worm
is killed by heat as soon as it has woven its home so
that it may not change to a moth and eat off some of
the silk in getting
out. Many thousand
worms are needed to
get enough silk for a
dress. The worms are
raised largely in China,
Japan, Italy, and
France.</p>

<p><b>Cotton.</b>&mdash;All calico,
muslin, and most cheap
clothing are made from
cotton thread. This is made from the cotton fibers
surrounding the seeds of the cotton plant (<a href="#i095">Fig. 52</a>).
The cotton used in this country is raised in the Southern
states.</p>

<p>Cotton clothing is stronger and wears much longer
than silk or wool, but it does not look so well and is
not nearly so warm.</p>

<p><b>The Use of Wraps and Overcoats.</b>&mdash;<i>Outer wraps
and overcoats should never be worn in a warm room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
or while working hard.</i> They cause much sweat to
form on the body, and as soon as one goes out of
doors the sweat begins to pass off. This makes the
body feel cold and in some cases leads to a long
sickness.</p>

<p>When riding in cold weather, extra wraps should
be worn. Scarfs and furs should not be worn about
the throat except in extreme cold weather. Bundling
up the neck and chin is likely to cause sore
throat.</p>

<p><b>Danger from Wet Clothing.</b>&mdash;Many children have
caught severe colds leading to serious sickness by
wearing wet or damp clothing. Wet clothing causes
the heat to pass off from the body quickly, so that it
is chilled before we know it. This may be shown by
wrapping two bottles of warm water in cloths. Wet
one cloth and let the other remain dry. In twenty
minutes the bottle with the wet cloth will be cool, but
the other one will still be warm. <i>If your wet clothing
cannot be changed at once, keep exercising or throw
a heavy coat about you.</i></p>

<p><b>Untidy and Soiled Clothing.</b>&mdash;All boys and girls
should learn to keep their clothing as clean as possible.
Do not wipe the hands on the clothing, or sit down in
the dirt, or let food smear the front of the coat or dress.</p>

<p>The sweat is constantly bringing waste matter out
of the body. This soils the clothing next to it. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
this account clothing to be washed every week or
oftener should be worn next to the skin. Very thin
cotton underclothing should be worn in summer.
Woolen clothes give more warmth for winter.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 53</span>
&mdash;Showing how to prevent the shoe from pressing on corns caused
by wearing tight shoes or socks roughly darned.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Shoes.</b>&mdash;Badly fitting shoes cause sore feet and
much pain. A shoe that is tight across the toes is
sure to cause corns. A <i>corn</i> is a thickened part of
the top skin which presses on the more tender part
beneath. Soaking the feet in hot water and filing off
the top of the corn or using a corn plaster will help
it. Shoes should always be a half inch longer than
the foot. Waterproof shoes or rubbers should be
worn in wet weather. Rubbers should not be worn
in the house.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol and Clothing.</b>&mdash;Many persons think that a
drink of whisky will make them warm when taken
on a cold day. For this reason whisky is sometimes
used when clothing is really needed. The use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
whisky or any other alcoholic drink will not make
the body warm. It may make one feel warm because
it loosens the muscles in the blood tubes of the skin
and so lets more blood come to the surface. In this
way the body becomes colder because too much blood
gets into the skin and is then chilled by the cold air.
As alcohol deadens the feeling it may prevent one
from feeling cold when the body is really very cold.
Too little clothing and too much alcohol have been
known to cause men to freeze to death.</p>

<p><b>Experience in using Alcohol to keep the Body Warm.</b>&mdash;Doctor
Hayes, who went as physician with Doctor
Kane to explore in the Arctic regions, said that he
would never again take alcoholic drink with him on
such a trip. He declared alcohol was of no use in
helping men to keep warm. He found from actual
experience that those who use alcohol cannot endure
cold so well as other people.</p>

<p>Doctor Carpenter, a well-known physician, tells of
a crew of sixty-six men who tried to stay in Hudson
Bay all winter. They used some alcoholic drink.
Only two of the party lived through the winter.
Later another party of twenty-two men passed the
winter in the same place. They used no strong
drink at any time and as a consequence all but two
of them were reported well and strong in the following
spring.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>BREATHING</h3>

<p><b>The Lungs.</b>&mdash;The lungs are two light spongy
bodies filling up the greater part of the chest. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
heart lies between the lungs. The lungs are formed
largely of thousands of thin-walled sacs and two sets
of tubes. One set of tubes carries air into and out of
the lungs, and the other set is filled with blood. These
sacs and tubes are held in place by a loose meshwork
of tissue.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i099" id="i099"></a>
<img src="images/i099.jpg" width="500" height="624" alt="Lungs" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 54</span>
&mdash;The ribs and front wall of the chest cut away to show the lungs.
A piece of one lung is cut off to show the heart. <i>A</i> and <i>E</i>, parts of the
breastbone; <i>F</i>, diaphragm.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Why we Breathe.</b>&mdash;Breathing means taking air into
the lungs and forcing it out. The air is made to go
into the lungs in order that a part of it called oxygen
may get into the blood. The blood then carries the
oxygen to all parts of the body where it can help the
organs do their work.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i100" id="i100"></a>
<img src="images/i100.jpg" width="150" height="74" alt="Gills" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 55</span>
&mdash;Photograph of a salamander, showing the gills on either side of the head,
which are used in breathing.</p>
</div>

<p>The air which comes out of the lungs is not the
same as that which goes in. Some of the oxygen has
been used up and in
its place is a heavier
gas named <i>carbon
dioxide</i>, which has
been given out by
the body. This carbon
dioxide is part
of the waste formed
in every part of the
body from the used-up food and dying parts of the
body. We breathe therefore to get oxygen into the
body and to take out some of the waste matter.</p>

<p>All animals must breathe. If our breath is shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
off only four or five minutes, death results. In the
earthworm the oxygen goes right through the skin
into the blood. Bugs and flies have several little
openings along the sides of the body which lead into
tubes branching throughout the body to carry air.
A fish gets air through its gills lying under a bony
flap on each side of the head.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i101" id="i101"></a>
<img src="images/i101.jpg" width="150" height="168" alt="Windpipe and lungs" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 56</span>
&mdash;The windpipe and lungs viewed from in front. On the right, the tissue is removed
to show the air tubes.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How the Air passes into the Lungs.</b>&mdash;The outer openings
of the nose
are called nostrils.
From here
two channels lead
back through the
nose to the throat.
The cavity of the
throat behind the
nose and tongue
is the <i>pharynx</i>.
At the bottom of
the pharynx is a
tube made mostly
of gristle. This
tube is larger than
your thumb and is named the <i>larynx</i>, or <i>voice box</i>.
The bump on its front part forms the lump in the
throat called the <i>Adam's Apple</i>.</p>

<p>From the voice box extends the <i>windpipe</i> called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
<i>trachea</i>, down to the lungs. The windpipe divides at
its lower end between the lungs into two branches.
One of these enters each lung.</p>

<p><b>The Air Tubes in the Lungs.</b>&mdash;As the branch of
the windpipe enters each lung it divides into smaller
branches just like the limbs of a tree. These divide
into still smaller tubes, which branch again and again
until they are as small as a hair. These hairlike
tubes have swollen ends called <i>air sacs</i>. The walls
of the air sacs are much thinner than tissue paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i102" id="i102"></a>
<img src="images/i102.jpg" width="500" height="233" alt="Air cells" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 57</span>
&mdash;A bunch of air cells at the end of an air tube in the lungs, showing
the blood vessels which receive the oxygen and give out the carbon dioxide.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How the Blood trades Waste for Oxygen in the Lungs.</b>&mdash;The
blood, which is constantly running from all
parts of the body to the lungs, collects waste formed
from the burnt food and dying parts of the organs.
When the blood comes to the lungs, it is full of this
waste, called carbon dioxide. The blood tubes divide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
into fine branches with very thin walls and form a
rich network over the air sacs. This allows the carbon
dioxide and water to pass out of the blood tubes
into the air sacs, while the oxygen at the same time
goes through into the blood. More than a pint of
water is given off in the breath daily.</p>

<p><b>How we Breathe.</b>&mdash;The bottom of the chest cavity
is formed by an upward arching sheet of muscle
called the <i>diaphragm</i>. This is fastened to the lower
ribs. The ribs at rest slant downward and inward.
When the ribs are pulled up or the arch of the diaphragm
down, the cavity of the chest becomes larger.
The air then runs into the lungs and swells them out.
When the ribs are let drop or the arch of the diaphragm
goes up, the air is pushed out of the lungs.</p>

<p>Without thinking, we work the muscles to draw
up the ribs about eighteen times every minute, because
all parts of the body are calling for oxygen.
The harder we work the oftener we breathe because
the muscles need more oxygen to make them go.</p>

<p><b>Why we should breathe through the Nose.</b>&mdash;Most
persons find it easy to breathe through the nose. In
some, however, the passages in the nose are too small
to carry the air without effort. On this account they
let the mouth hang open and breathe through it.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i104" id="i104"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 58</span>
&mdash;Face cut through the middle to show how the adenoids stop the air from passing
through the nose. Arrows show the course which the air should take.</p>
</div>

<p>The air should pass only through the nose because
it is lined with hairs and tiny waving threads which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
catch the dust. In this way germs and dirt are
prevented from
getting into the
throat and lungs,
and in winter the
cold air is warmed.</p>

<p><b>Why Some Children
cannot
breathe through
the Nose.</b>&mdash;When
one has a cold, the
lining of the nose
becomes swollen
and gives out a
white substance
called <i>mucus</i>.
The swelling of
the lining and the
mucus fill up the
passages. The
nose should be
kept clean by using a handkerchief and blowing out
the mucus into it. <i>Never put the finger into the nose.</i>
Disease germs often get on the fingers from things
touched.</p>

<p>Children who have the habit of breathing through
the mouth should be examined by a physician. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
will, in most cases, find soft spongy growths called
<i>adenoids</i> in the back part of the nose. They should
always be removed as soon as possible. They may
cause disease or deafness and may even injure the
mind.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 59</span>
&mdash;A view of the voice box from the top.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Voice.</b>&mdash;In the upper part of the voice box at
the top of the windpipe is a fold of tissue stretched
on either side. These two folds of tissue form the
<i>vocal cords</i>. The air rushing past them causes sound.
The different sounds are made by stretching the cords
tight or loosely. By means of the tongue, teeth, and
lips the sound is formed into words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span><b>How to use the Voice.</b>&mdash;A cold or much shouting
makes the vocal cords swell and we become hoarse.
Rest is the best cure. It is not polite to shout or
whistle in the house and you should never use an
angry tone of voice. When talking to a person, always
speak distinctly but pleasantly and turn your
face toward his and look directly into his eyes.
Never use a harsh, loud tone of voice.</p>

<p><b>Why you should not spit on Floors or Sidewalks.</b>&mdash;We
used to think that any one well had no germs
of sickness in his mouth, but we now know that many
well persons have germs in their mouths which can
cause long sickness when they get into other persons.
If you are sick with diphtheria, scarlet fever, or sore
throat, the germs of the disease are likely to remain
in your mouth two or three months. Persons with
tuberculosis throw out millions of these germs in
their spit every day.</p>

<p>Spitting is not only an unclean habit but a deadly
curse. Spit often contains the seeds of death.
Women's skirts and the soles of our shoes carry it
into the houses. It becomes dry, but the germs live
and float about in the dust, then enter the mouth to
make us sick. Carelessness with spit is said to cause
more than a hundred deaths every day in our land.</p>

<p><b>Do not use an Open Spittoon.</b>&mdash;It is much safer to
have a smallpox patient in the house than an open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
spittoon in the summer. You can prevent the smallpox
by vaccination, but you cannot keep the flies from
carrying ten thousand germs
of death from the spittoon
to the food on the table. A
million germs have been
found on a single fly.</p>

<p>Spit should be dropped
into a cup which should be
kept covered when not being
used. The spit should
be destroyed by fire or
some germ-killing fluid,
such as lye or formalin.</p>

<p><b>Keeping Sickness away
from the Throat and Lungs.</b>&mdash;All
sickness of the throat and lungs is caught from
some one else. The germs are passed from one to
another on the drinking
cup, by sucking
pencils, wetting the
finger to turn the
pages of a book, or
putting the fingers in
the nose or mouth.</p>

&mdash;A dish of beef broth jelly left open two minutes in a room
being swept. Each spot is a city of thousands of germs which grew
from one germ dropping on the jelly. By counting the spots you
can tell how many germs fell from the dust on this dish three inches
in diameter.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Dust is the partner
of disease.</i> It contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
germs. Avoid dust.
Wipe up the rooms with
a damp cloth; never use
a feather duster. Avoid
dry sweeping. Use a
suction cleaner or have
rugs which can be cleaned
out of doors.</p>

<p>Give the lungs fresh
air and deep breathing
and the body good food
and plenty of sleep to
make it so strong that
germs cannot overcome
it when they enter.</p>

<p><b>Alcoholic Drink and
the Lungs.</b>&mdash;The most
common disease of the
lungs is <i>tuberculosis</i>.
Nearly all bartenders
who sell strong drink
take some themselves.
Lately it has been learned
in Germany that tuberculosis
causes one half of
all the deaths among bartenders.
Alcohol was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
once thought to be a good medicine for lung troubles,
but it has been clearly proven that beer and whisky
weaken the lungs and make them ready for the germs
of disease. The body already weakened by the poison
of the alcohol is then easily overcome by the disease.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco and the Lungs.</b>&mdash;The occasional use of tobacco
does not seem to hurt the lungs when fully
grown. A study of many young persons has shown
that the chest of smokers grows much more slowly
than in those who do not use tobacco. As the lungs
cannot grow any faster than the chest, they must
grow slowly in boys using much tobacco.</p>

<p>Tobacco is a common cause of sore throat. Many
smokers have been compelled to quit the habit because
of throat troubles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>FRESH AIR AND HEALTH</h3>

<p><b>How much Air we Breathe.</b>&mdash;At every breath we
take in about one pint of air. We breathe eighteen
times each minute. Nine quarts of air therefore
pass in and out of the lungs every minute. Air
once breathed is not fit to breathe again. It contains
waste and carbon dioxide which weaken the body.</p>

<p>If you breathe three full breaths into a wide-mouthed
jar or bottle, it will contain so much of the
carbon dioxide that a lighted candle or splinter will
at once go out when thrust into the jar. A cat shut
in a tight box two feet square and one foot high will
die in less than a half hour.</p>

<p>Many years ago when the British and Hindoo
soldiers were fighting each other, the Hindoos made
prisoners of 146 of the British and locked them in a
room about one half as large as a common schoolroom.
There were only two small windows. During
the night 123 of these men died because of the bad air.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 64</span>
&mdash;The direction of the flame of the candle shows how the fresh air enters and the
bad air leaves a room.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How much Air should enter a Room.</b>&mdash;The air
laden with waste coming out of the lungs quickly
mixes with the other air of the room. In this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
all of the air in the room soon becomes impure.
Forty children will give out nearly two barrels of air
in one minute. In another
minute this air has made all
of the other air in the room
unclean. It can still be
breathed, but it makes children
feel drowsy and lazy
and may cause headache.
They then do poor work.</p>

<p>To keep the air pure in
a room, fresh air must be let
in from the outside. If there
are many in the room, the
openings must be large or
fans on a wheel must be
used to force the air in. In
the New York schools a little
over a cubic yard of fresh
air is forced into the room
for each child every minute.</p>

<p><b>How to get Fresh Air into a Room.</b>&mdash;When air is
warmed it becomes lighter and rises. In many public
buildings, fresh air heated by a furnace is forced into
the rooms through pipes entering several feet above the
floor. By a fan or heated flue the impure air is sucked
out of the room through openings near the floor.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">

&mdash;How the windows of your bedroom should be open to get the most fresh air.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>Changing the air in a room is called <i>ventilation</i>.
To get plenty of fresh air in a room there must be
one or more places for it to enter and one or more
places for it to pass out. Where there is no furnace
or fan, windows on one side of the room may be
opened at the bottom
to let in the air and
the same windows
opened at the top to
let the impure air
escape. <i>Do not sit
in a draft</i>, but use a
board or curtain to
throw the air upward
as it enters the window.
<i>A room should
not be kept too warm.</i>
Sitting in a very
warm room weakens
the body and prepares
it to take cold. The temperature of a living
room should be between 65 and 70 degrees.</p>

<p><b>Fresh Air while you Sleep.</b>&mdash;Thousands of people
have weakened their bodies and brought on disease by
sleeping in bad air. Many persons keep their windows
so tightly closed during the night that the air smells
bad in the morning. I knew a family who always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
slept with windows closed except in the very warmest
weather. Three of the children died of tuberculosis,
and a fourth one took the disease but was saved by
keeping his windows wide open.</p>

<p>Bad air in the sleeping room makes one feel
drowsy in the morning instead of refreshed by sleep.
<i>Your windows should always be open while you sleep.</i>
In cold weather a window should be open a foot at
both the bottom and the top, or if there are two windows
in the room, both may be opened at the bottom.
In moderate weather the openings should be twice
as large. A cap may be worn to keep the head
warm, and the bed should be out of the draft.</p>

<p><b>Fresh Air gives Health.</b>&mdash;Four hundred people die of
tuberculosis in our country every day. A few years ago
it was thought that no one could get well of this disease.
Now three fourths of those in the first stages of the disease
get well. The chief part of the cure is fresh air.
Medicine is seldom used because no medicine will cure
tuberculosis. Good food and rest are great helps.</p>

<p>Many of those with tuberculosis stay out of doors
all day and at night sleep in tents or with all of
the windows wide open, even in the coldest weather.
Snow may blow in and the water in the room may
turn to solid ice, but fresh air, the good angel of
health, will give the body new strength and make it
well and strong again.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>Many years ago when the Indians lived in tents
and often slept outdoors none of them had this dirty
air disease of tuberculosis.
Since they
have formed the habit
of living in houses
nearly one half of
some tribes have become
sick with this
catching disease.</p>

<p><b>Making the Lungs
Strong.</b>&mdash;It requires
over three quarts of
air to fill your lungs.
When you breathe
quietly, less than one
pint of air passes in
and out of your lungs.
This shows that a large part of the lungs is not used.
The air sacs at the top and in the bottom part of the
lungs are seldom filled completely. It is in these
places that disease begins.</p>

<p>Several minutes should be spent two or three times
each day in exercising the lungs. Fill them completely
with air many times. <i>Learn to breathe deeply
while you are walking in the fresh air.</i> Hold the head
up and the shoulders back so that every part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
lungs can be filled. <i>Sit straight. Your life depends
upon your lungs.</i> Give them a chance to do their
work and teach them to do it well.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco and Pure Air.</b>&mdash;There is poison in the smoke
of tobacco. This is shown by its effect on insects.
Owners of greenhouses
often buy the stems
and other waste parts
of tobacco. They pile
it in a pan and after
closing the doors and
windows of the greenhouse
tightly, set fire
to it. The smoke
rises and fills the
whole house. In less
than an hour it has
killed many of the
bugs and beetles
which were destroying
the plants.</p>

<p>A person not used
to tobacco will sometimes be made sick by sitting
only an hour in a room where persons are smoking.
It is wrong for smokers to poison the air which
others must breathe. For this reason a smoking
room should be well ventilated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE BLOOD AND HOW IT FLOWS THROUGH THE BODY</h3>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i116" id="i116"></a>
<img src="images/i116.jpg" width="150" height="117" alt="Blood cells" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 68</span>
&mdash;The cells in the blood. The two white ones were drawn while crawling. Much enlarged.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Blood keeps the Body Clean within and gives it
Food.</b>&mdash;Every tiny particle of the body, whether in
the legs, arms, or head, must have food to keep it alive
and help it do its work. It must also have oxygen,
and it must be washed clean of its waste matter.
All this is done by the streams of blood, which bathe
every cell to
bring it food
and oxygen
and to wash
away its waste.</p>

<p><b>Parts of the
Blood.</b>&mdash;Blood
consists of a
clear, watery
part called
<i>plasma</i> and
many little
bodies named <i>cells</i>. The liquid found in a blister is
the clear part of the blood. The cells which float in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the watery part are so little and so close together
that more than a million are in each drop of blood.</p>

<p>A few of the cells are white, but most of them are
red, and it is their color that makes the blood look
red. Your body contains about one gallon of blood.
It is carried through the body in branching tubes
called <i>blood vessels</i> (<a href="#i119">Fig. 70</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i117" id="i117"></a>
<img src="images/i117.jpg" width="150" height="154" alt="The heart" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 69</span>
&mdash;Photograph of the heart from in front with the lungs pinned aside. One fourth natural
size.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Blood Vessels.</b>&mdash;There are four kinds of blood
vessels. They are the <i>heart</i>, the <i>arteries</i>, the <i>capillaries</i>,
and the <i>veins</i>.
The heart lies in
the chest between
the lungs. It
squeezes the
blood into the
arteries. These
carry the blood
to all parts of the
body. It then
runs into the capillaries,
which are
tiny tubes connecting
the arteries
with the veins. The veins return the blood to
the heart.</p>

<p>The blood flows so fast that it goes from the heart
down to the toes and back again in a half minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]<br />[Pg 120]</a></span><b>The Heart or Pump of Life.</b>&mdash;When the heart
stops we die, because the blood can no longer flow to
carry food and oxygen to the hungry tissues. The
heart is a sac with thick walls of muscle. It is
shaped like a strawberry and is about as large as
your fist. Its cavity is divided into four parts. The
two upper ones are called <i>auricles</i> and the lower ones
are named <i>ventricles</i>. The blood enters the auricles
and then pours through an opening into each ventricle,
from which it passes out into the arteries.</p>

<p><b>The Arteries or Sending Tubes.</b>&mdash;The blood is sent
out from the heart through the arteries leading to all
parts of the body. The chief artery is the <i>aorta</i>. It
is larger than your thumb and extends from the heart
down through the body in front of the backbone.
It has more than twenty branches. All of these
branch again and again like the limbs of a tree until
they are finer than hairs.</p>

<p>A large tube, the <i>lung artery</i>, takes blood directly
from the heart to the lungs. Here it branches into
more than a thousand divisions, so that the blood
can take in oxygen and give off to the lungs its
waste.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i119" id="i119"></a>
<img src="images/i119.jpg" width="500" height="860" alt="Arteries" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 70</span>
&mdash;Arteries, the tubes carrying the blood from the heart through the
body. Only the chief vessels are shown on one side.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Capillaries or Feeding Tubes.</b>&mdash;These are the
tiny tubes, finer than hairs, which join the smallest
end branches of the arteries with the beginnings of
the little veins. They are so thickly scattered in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
flesh that you cannot stick it with a pin without
piercing one.</p>

<p>They are called feeding tubes because they have
such very thin walls that the food in the blood and
the oxygen brought from the lungs can pass through
to feed the muscles and other organs. The dead
parts of the body and also the ashes of the food used
up, pass from the organs into the capillaries.</p>

<p><b>The Veins or Returning Tubes.</b>&mdash;The veins, beginning
in fine branches formed by the capillaries, return
the blood to the heart. The branches unite into
larger and larger vessels and finally flow into one
main vein, the <i>vena cava</i>. This extends along in
front of the backbone and opens into the heart.</p>

<p><b>Why the Blood flows in only one Direction.</b>&mdash;The
heart causes the flow of the blood. It does this by
squeezing together its walls so as to make the blood
go out into the arteries. When once in the arteries,
the blood must go forward because there are little
doors at the mouths of the arteries in the heart.
These doors, called <i>valves</i>, open in only one direction,
so that the blood cannot flow backward (<a href="#i121">Fig. 71</a>).
There are other valves between the upper and lower
cavities of the heart, preventing the blood from being
pushed back into the veins.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i121" id="i121"></a>
<img src="images/i121.jpg" width="150" height="182" alt="The heart" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 71</span>
&mdash;The heart with the front part cut away to show the four chambers and
valves. The arrows show the direction in which the blood flows.</p>
</div>

<p>The movement of the walls of the heart in and
out is called the <i>heart beat</i>. This can be plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
felt by placing the hand on the left side of the chest.
The heart beats about seventy times each minute
in grown persons, but
much oftener in
children. At each
beat a wave of blood
flows along the arteries.
This is known
as the <i>pulse</i>. It may
be felt at the base of
the thumb, where an
artery runs just
under the skin.</p>

<p><b>Why the Heart
sometimes beats
Faster.</b>&mdash;When we
run or do hard work,
the heart may beat twice as fast as when we are
lying down. This is because the muscles need more
oxygen to help them act. Work makes them get
hungry, and they send word by the nerves to the
heart to hurry along the blood to bring more oxygen
from the lungs.</p>

<p>When germs make the body sick, the heart often
beats faster because it is affected by the poison made
by the germs. The doctor then feels the pulse to tell
how much the body is poisoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span><b>Use of Blood Cells.</b>&mdash;The red cells act like boats.
They load up with oxygen in the lungs and carry it
to all parts of the body. Here they trade it off for
carbon dioxide, a waste substance. This they carry
back to the lungs to be cast out of the body.</p>

<p>There is one white blood cell to every four
hundred red ones. The white cells are the body-guards.
They change their shape and are able to
crawl through the walls of the capillaries. Wherever
the body is hurt, they collect in large numbers
and eat the germs which are always trying to get
into the body through sores. The white matter
called <i>pus</i> in a sore is largely made of white blood
cells which came there to fight the germs and were
killed in the battle.</p>

<p>The germs of boils and fevers often get into the
blood, but the white cells usually kill them before
they have a chance to grow into large numbers and
make the body sick.</p>

<p><b>How to stop Bleeding.</b>&mdash;Most of the larger arteries
are deep in the flesh and seldom get cut. There are
many veins just under the skin. If the blood comes
out in spurts, it is from an artery; but if it flows
steadily, it is from a vein. If the blood does not run
out in a stream, it will stop without any special care.
As soon as the blood gets to the air it forms a jellylike
mass called a <i>clot</i>. This helps stop the flow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
All hurt places in the skin should be tied up in a
clean cloth.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 72</span>
&mdash;Stopping the flow of blood from an artery.</p>
</div>

<p>If a large artery is cut, a bandage twisted tight
with a stick around
the limb on the side
of the wound next to
the heart will stop the
bleeding. If a vein
is cut, the bandage
should be placed on
the side of the cut
away from the heart.</p>

<p><b>Alcoholic Drinks
weaken the Blood.</b>&mdash;It
has been noticed
for some years that
when a user of beer
or whisky is attacked
with fever, the disease
is more severe
than in one not using
alcohol. The reason
for this has lately been
explained by a well-known scientist working in Paris.
He put certain disease germs in rabbits, but they did
not become sick. When he gave them a little alcohol
and put the same amount of disease germs in them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
as before, they became sick and died. By careful
study he learned that the white blood cells had in
the first case killed the germs. In the second experiment
the blood cells were made so weak and lazy
by the alcohol that they did not put up such a strong
fight against the germs.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco and the Blood.</b>&mdash;Any one who chews or
smokes tobacco regularly gets much of the poison into
the blood. The vessels in the mouth and throat
drink in some of the juice and also the poison from
the smoke. How much this poison affects the blood
cells is not known, but it is likely to do them some
harm because it makes the growing cells of the body
less active.</p>

<p><b>How Beer weakens the Heart.</b>&mdash;Whisky was at
one time thought to strengthen the heart, but doctors
generally agree now that it weakens the heart. It
may make the heart beat a little stronger for a few
minutes, but after that the beating is weaker than
usual.</p>

<p>Much use of beer is known to make fat collect
around the heart and also cause some of the heart
muscle itself to change into fat. In this way the
heart becomes so weak that it can no longer do its
work, and death results. The reports from Germany
show that hundreds of persons die every year from
weakened hearts made so by the use of much beer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span><b>Alcohol hurts the Blood Vessels.</b>&mdash;Careful examination
of the blood vessels of drunkards after death
shows that in many cases the alcohol has caused the
walls of the vessels to become thick and sometimes
hard. The thickening of the wall makes the channel
of the tube smaller. The heart must then work
much harder to get the blood through to feed the
tissues.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco and the Heart.</b>&mdash;Many boys who use tobacco
regularly do not have a steady heart beat.
This is specially true of those who smoke several
cigarettes daily. A few years ago, when our country
was at war with Spain, thousands of young men,
wanted for soldiers, were examined to find out
whether their bodies were strong enough to endure
the hardships of war. Hundreds were refused admittance
to the army because of weak bodies, and
many of them were reported by the physicians as
having hearts weakened by the use of tobacco.</p>

<p>The boys preparing for the army at the Military
Academy at West Point and for sea fighting at the
Naval Academy at Annapolis are not allowed to smoke
cigarettes. Our country must have strong men for
hard work. Tobacco never gives strength, but often
causes weakness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>INSECTS AND HEALTH</h3>

<p><b>Malaria or Chills and Fever.</b>&mdash;Malaria is a disease
in which the patient usually has a chill followed by
a fever at the same time each day or every other day.
Thousands of people suffer from this sickness in the
warm parts of our country and hundreds of them die
every year. In some regions people cannot live because
this sickness attacks every one who comes there.</p>

<p>Many years ago a doctor found in the blood of
malaria patients tiny animals. He thought that
they might be the cause of the illness, but he could
not find out how they got into the blood.</p>

<p><b>Finding out how Malaria Germs get into the Blood.</b>&mdash;It
had been noticed for many years that mosquitoes
were always found wherever there was malaria.
In the year 1900 two men decided to find out if they
could live in a malaria region and not have the disease
when the mosquitoes were kept from biting
them.</p>

<p>They made their home a whole season in a cottage
in the midst of many persons who were sick with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
malaria. They breathed the same air, ate the same
kind of food, and drank the same kind of water as
those who suffered from the
disease, but they remained
well. The only thing that
they did different from those
who got sick was to keep the
mosquitoes out of their rooms
at night by means of screens.
This experiment and many
other studies have shown that
we catch malaria only by the
bites of mosquitoes.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 74</span>
&mdash;Position of the malaria mosquito at rest.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Only a Few Mosquitoes carry
Malaria.</b>&mdash;Malaria is not common
in all regions where mosquitoes live, and it has
been found that only one group of mosquitoes carries
the germs. The two common
groups are the straight-backed
and the humped. To
prove that the
straight-backed
ones did the
harm several of
them were allowed
to suck blood from a man sick with malaria
in Italy. They were then sent to London and let bite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
a healthy man. In a few days he became sick with
malaria. Many experiments with the humped-back
mosquitoes, found nearly everywhere in our country,
show that they do not carry malaria germs.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Fever.</b>&mdash;Until 1901 yellow fever was the
scourge of many cities in the South. Thousands of
persons lost their lives from it. Wherever the dread
disease broke out in a city many persons would flee
to the country because they thought that they could
not breathe the air without getting the germs.</p>

<p>Some persons thought that mosquitoes might cause
the disease, and in 1900 experiments were carried out
in Cuba to learn whether mosquitoes really did carry
yellow fever germs. Seven men made their home in
a room well screened to keep out the mosquitoes.
They used clothing which had been worn by others
sick with the fever and even slept on pillows and
blankets on which yellow fever victims had died.
Many persons thought that these bedclothes were full
of fever germs and that all the men would surely get
the disease. Not one of them, however, got sick
although they lived in the midst of these soiled materials
for three weeks.</p>

<p>Seven other men were chosen for another experiment.
A large room was prepared and made thoroughly
clean. Only clean bedding and clean clothes
were used. The men were given pure food and pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
water, but into the room were let loose mosquitoes
which had been sucking blood from a person sick
with the fever. In
a few days six of
the seven men became
sick with the
fever and one of
them died. From
these experiments
and other studies
we now know that
<i>this dreadful fever
is carried from the sick to the well only by the bites of
mosquitoes</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>How Mosquitoes Live.</b>&mdash;Before we can get rid of
any pests we must know where the eggs are hatched
and the young
pass their early
life. The eggs of
mosquitoes are
laid on standing
water. The water
may be in an old
tomato can, a rain barrel, a cistern, or a large pond.
A day or two after the mother lays one or two
hundred eggs, they hatch into dark, wriggling objects
called <i>wigglers</i>. In from ten to twenty days later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
they change into flying mosquitoes. These habits
of life show that the easiest time to kill them is when
they are young.</p>

&mdash;Photograph of wigglers, the stage in which the mosquito lives a

</div>

<p><b>Getting rid of Mosquitoes.</b>&mdash;During warm weather
mosquitoes cause the death of more than a thousand
persons in the world every day besides making many
others very sick. To get rid of mosquitoes is to prevent
sickness and death. In one year yellow fever
killed over five thousand people in New York and
Philadelphia because
the doctors did not
know how to stop the
disease from spreading.</p>

<p>When this fever
broke out in New
Orleans in 1905, less
than five hundred persons
died of it because
the doctors had then
learned that the disease
is spread only by the yellow fever mosquito.
They therefore began killing the mosquitoes. Kerosene
was poured over all the ponds and stagnant
pools of water which could not be drained. This
kills the young mosquitoes because the oil gets into
their breathing tube which they stick up to the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of the water to get air. All rain barrels and tin
cans were emptied and cisterns were tightly covered.
Men, women, and children worked week days and
Sundays killing mosquitoes because they knew that
they were saving human life. The destroying fever
was stopped.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Flies cause much Sickness.</b>&mdash;Very few people are
afraid of house flies because they do not bite. Although
they are so small and seemingly harmless yet
we know that they
cause many more
deaths every year
than mad dogs, poisonous
snakes, and all
wild beasts.</p>

<p>Flies crawl around
among slops, in spittoons,
and in other
unclean places. In
this way they get thousands of germs of tuberculosis,
typhoid fever, and cholera on their feet and then scatter
them over our food as they crawl about on the table, in
the grocery store, or among the milk cans. In our last
war with Spain more than a thousand of our soldiers
were made sick with fever carried to them by flies.</p>

<p>In Denver, Colorado, in 1908 fifty persons were
made sick with the fever by flies which fed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
slops from a sick room and then crawled around in the
milk cans from which those who became sick used milk.</p>

&mdash;Photograph of the worm stage or larva of the fly at the left and three

</div>

<p><b>How to fight the Flies.</b>&mdash;House flies lay at one
time about one hundred eggs in the dirt thrown out
of horse stables, in
garbage cans, or in
any other unclean
place. In a day or
two the eggs hatch
into little white
worms which feed on
the dirt. One or two
weeks later the
worms change to flies.</p>

<p>Flies may be kept
out of houses by putting screens in the windows and
doors or by darkening the rooms when they are not
in use. The few which gain entrance may be
caught in fly traps. All food in the store or
the home should be kept covered. It is not safe
to eat candy on which flies have wiped their feet or
to drink the milk in which they have washed them.</p>

&mdash;Photograph of a half handful of manure which had been thrown out of a
horse stable. Note more than one hundred houseflies in the sleeping stage.</p>
</div>

<p>The surest way to get rid of flies in any community
is for all the people to work together and keep the
entire neighborhood clean. No dead grass, weeds, or
rags should be allowed to lie in the backyards or
alleys. The cleanings from stables should be hauled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
away every week or stored in tightly covered boxes.
Garbage cans must have close-fitting lids, so that
there will be no place
in which the young
may hatch and grow.</p>

<p><b>Other Insects which
carry Disease.</b>&mdash;In
certain parts of
Africa, the <i>sleeping
sickness</i> has made
ruins of prosperous
villages. Thousands
of the natives are dying
yearly from this
disease. The germs are carried from one person to
another by the bite of a fly.</p>

<p>Some fleas carry the germs of <i>plague</i>, which a few
centuries ago swept across Asia and Europe destroying
hundreds of lives daily. The plague is now
common in India and was present in California in
1908 and 1910. The bedbug spreads several kinds
of fevers in warm countries and may also be a carrier
of leprosy and typhoid fever. These facts show that insects
are dangerous and should be kept out of the home.</p>

<p>Any one troubled with these little pests in the
house may learn how to get rid of them by writing
to the Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>HOW THE BODY MOVES</h3>

<p><b>The Need of a Framework.</b>&mdash;The body needs a stiff
framework made of bones for three purposes. One
purpose is to give it shape, a second purpose is to
help the body move, and a third one is to protect
from injury some of the delicate organs, such as the
heart and brain.</p>

<p>The bones are nowhere separate but are joined
together with tough bands named <i>ligaments</i>. All
the bones together form the <i>skeleton</i>.</p>

<p>All animals from fish to man have a skeleton.
Many of the lower creatures, such as worms and flies,
have no bony skeleton. Most of these move sluggishly
or have a hardened outer covering, like beetles
and wasps. The skeleton of animals such as the
cat, rabbit, or cow, has about the same number of
bones as man, and they are arranged in the same
way.</p>

<p><b>Of what a Bone is Made.</b>&mdash;Although the bones are
so hard, they are not dead. They contain blood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]<br />[Pg 137]</a></span>
have feeling, and are just as much alive as the
softer parts of the body. It is the lime that makes
them stiff. This can be eaten out by putting the
bone in strong vinegar or other acid for a few days.
A long bone will then become so limber that it can
be tied into a knot.</p>

<p>The living part of a bone can be burned out by
placing it on hot coals for a half hour. At the end
of this time the bone will look just as before, but
when it is touched, will crumble to pieces.</p>

<p><b>Forms of Bones.</b>&mdash;The bones of the legs and arms
are hollow. This form gives the greatest strength
with the least weight. You can prove this by using
two sheets of paper. Roll one sheet and fold the
other one. Hang weights on both ends of each and
use the finger for a support in the middle.</p>

<p>The cavity of these bones is filled with a soft
white substance called <i>marrow</i>. This is largely fat.
Each bone is surrounded by a tough membrane to
which the muscles are attached.</p>

<p><b>Arrangement of the Bones.</b>&mdash;The bones of the head
form the <i>skull</i>. The other bones of the body not
belonging to the <i>limbs</i> make up the <i>trunk</i>. There
are over two hundred bones in the entire body.
Eight of these form a case for the brain. Fourteen
give shape to the face. A chain of twenty-six bones
named <i>vertebræ</i> forms the backbone.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i136" id="i136"></a>
<img src="images/i136.jpg" width="500" height="879" alt="The skeleton" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 81</span>
&mdash;Photograph of the bones of the skeleton.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>Twelve pairs of <i>ribs</i> encircle the chest. They are
fastened behind to the backbone. The front parts of
the ribs are made of pieces of gristle. The seven
upper pairs are joined to the breastbone. The five
lower pairs are named <i>false ribs</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>collar bone</i> is in front of the shoulder and
behind it is the flat <i>shoulder blade</i>. There is one
bone in the upper part of each arm and leg and two
bones in the lower part of each limb. Twenty-eight
small bones are found in the hand, while twenty-seven
are present in the foot.</p>

<p><b>How the Bones may be Injured.</b>&mdash;In the young
some of the entire bones and parts of many others
are soft like gristle. For this reason, the bones of
the young seldom get broken, but they are easily
bent and pressed out of their natural shape. On this
account you should hold the body erect in sitting and
walking. Bending over the table or desk day after
day is not only likely to cause round shoulders, but is
sure to squeeze up the lungs and other organs so they
cannot do their best work.</p>

<p>Sitting at a table or desk, so that one shoulder is
higher than the other or carrying books at the side,
so that they rest on the hip may cause a curve sidewise
in the backbone. Tight clothing about the
waist presses the ribs out of shape and hurts the
other organs within the body.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i138" id="i138"></a>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 82</span>
&mdash;How the bones are held together. A piece has been cut out of the tough ligament to show
the cup of the hip bone into which the head of the thigh bone fits.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span><b>Caring for Broken Bones.</b>&mdash;When a bone of the
arm or leg is broken, the muscles tend to make the
ends shove over
each other. The
broken ends are
sometimes sharp,
and if the limb
is bent, these
may tear through
the flesh. This
may be prevented
by binding a
board firmly on
opposite sides of
the limb across
the broken part. This will hold the bones in place
until the surgeon comes and will also allow the
patient to be moved.</p>

<p>The surgeon will set the broken bones by bringing
the ends together and holding them in place by sheets
of wood or metal firmly held by a bandage. In a
few days the membrane around the bone begins to
grow new bone to join the broken parts.</p>

<p><b>How the Bones are joined together.</b>&mdash;The two
general classes of joints are the <i>movable</i> and <i>immovable</i>.
Except the lower jaw, the bones of the skull are so
tightly joined together that there is no motion between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]<br />[Pg 141]</a></span>
them. The bones of the wrist and back have but
little movement. The freest motion is at the shoulder
joint, where the round head of one bone fits into the
shallow cup of another. This is called a <i>ball and
socket joint</i>. Such a joint is found also at the hip.
At the elbow and knee the bones move back and forth
like a hinge and these are named <i>hinge joints</i>.</p>

<p><b>Working Parts of a Joint.</b>&mdash;The ends of the bones
are covered with a thin layer of gristle. The bones
are held in place by several strong bands called <i>ligaments</i>
(<a href="#i138">Fig. 82</a>). These entirely surround the joint.
On their inner sides is a delicate membrane which gives
out a slippery fluid to make the joint work easily.</p>

<p>The ligaments are sometimes strained, stretched,
or torn by a fall. The joint then swells because the
watery part of the blood collects there. A sprained
limb should be elevated to prevent swelling. Bathing
it in very hot water is helpful.</p>

<p><b>The Muscles.</b>&mdash;The muscles form the lean meat in
any animal. They make up about one half the
weight of the body. Each muscle is a bundle of
thousands of little threads held together by other
finer threads, while the whole is surrounded by a thin
sheet. Little bundles formed of several of these
threads called fibers may be seen in a piece of cooked
beef picked to pieces. There are over five hundred
muscles in the body.</p>

&mdash;The biceps muscle contracted above and relaxed or loosened below.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>Some of the muscles are more than a foot long and
have the shape of a ribbon. Some are circular like
those around the mouth, eyes, and stomach, while
others are large in
the middle and
taper toward the
ends.</p>

<p><b>How the Muscles
are fastened
to the Bones.</b>&mdash;The
two ends of
a muscle are
attached to different
bones. In
many cases the
muscle is not
joined directly to
the bone, but is
connected to a tough white cord called a <i>tendon</i>.
The tendon is then fixed to the bone.</p>

<p>Several of the muscles in the forearm run into tendons
in the wrist because if the muscle part were to
extend along the wrist, this part of the arm would be
large and clumsy instead of graceful and slender.
Some of these tendons may be seen to move by bending
the wrist and then working the fingers.</p>

<p><b>How the Muscles do their Work.</b>&mdash;A tiny nerve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
thread runs from the spinal cord or brain to every
muscle thread. Messages sent through the nerve
threads to the muscles make them act. A muscle
can act in only two ways (<a href="#i141">Fig. 84</a>). It can become
shorter or longer. When it gets shorter, we say it
<i>contracts</i>. When it stretches out, it is said to <i>relax</i>.</p>

<p>A muscle cannot contract more than one fourth of
its length. To pull the forearm up, the brain sends a
message to the muscle fixed by one end at the shoulder
and by the other end to a bone at the elbow. The
muscle at once becomes shorter and thicker, as may
be felt by placing the fingers on it. Although it
shortens only two inches it is fastened to the bone
so near the elbow that it draws the hand up two feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE MUSCLES AND HEALTH</h3>

<p><b>Making the Muscles Strong.</b>&mdash;No persons use all
of the five hundred muscles in the body every day.
In slow walking only about twenty muscles are used,
while in running more than four times that number
are called into action. Muscles which are not used
get lazy and weak.</p>

<p>Every time a muscle is made to act the blood
vessels enlarge and bring to it more blood to supply
food. The more food the muscle has the stronger
it grows. The right arm is used more than the left
in most persons. This makes it so much stronger
that some boys can lift twenty-five pounds more with
the right arm than they can with the left.</p>

<p><b>Using the Muscles keeps the Body Well.</b>&mdash;All
muscles must have more blood when they are used so
that the heart is made to beat faster and stronger by
exercise. In this way its valves and walls become
able to do more work. Such a heart not only does
its work better in a well person, but is able to keep
pumping when the body is weakened by disease.
Many persons die because the heart gets too weak to
push the blood through the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>In all the little spaces between the muscles and
parts of other organs is some watery part of the blood
containing much waste given off from the tissues.
Moving the muscles presses on this watery waste in
such a way as to move it along into the blood channels.
It then can be cast out of the body by the
lungs and other organs. One reason why we feel so
good after exercise is because the poisonous waste
has been taken away.</p>

<p>No one can remain well very long without taking
exercise. Children as well as older persons should
enjoy one or two hours of outdoor play every day.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i144" id="i144"></a>
<img src="images/i144.jpg" width="500" height="220" alt="Exercises" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 85</span>
&mdash;Various ways of exercising the muscles to keep the body well.</p>
</div>

<p><b>How to exercise the Muscles.</b>&mdash;Outdoor games
give the best form of exercise. Tennis, baseball,
cricket, rowing, and swimming are sports which bring
nearly all the muscles into use. Every boy and girl
should learn to swim. It is dangerous to go swimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
alone or to swim in deep water. Cramp may
seize the muscles at any time, so that the limbs cannot
be moved. Hundreds of persons are drowned
every year by venturing in deep water.</p>

<p>Taking care of the yard and garden and helping
with other work about the home is one of the best
ways of getting exercise and at the same time doing
some good.</p>

<p><b>Special Kinds of Exercise.</b>&mdash;A room with ropes,
swings, and machines in it for exercise is called a
<i>gymnasium</i>. Under the direction of a teacher the
pupils can get quickly just the right kind of exercise
to strengthen the weak parts of the body and keep
every organ in health. The muscles oftenest neglected
are those of the chest. Every one should keep
his chest full and round by swinging the arms and
<i>practicing deep breathing every day</i>.</p>

<p><b>Danger from too much Exercise.</b>&mdash;Lately it has
been learned that very violent exercise for more than
a few minutes often injures the heart. The running
of many races until you are all out of breath or much
jumping of the rope is likely to strain the heart. It
is always harmful to urge the body on until it is completely
tired out.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol makes the Muscles Weak.</b>&mdash;In the year
1903 two learned men in Switzerland spent much
time to determine whether alcohol helped persons do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
more work. They tried more than two hundred
experiments with men to whom they sometimes gave
wine and sometimes food, and sometimes both were
given together.</p>

<p>The results of these tests showed that when wine
was given alone, the man's ability to do work was
increased for a short time, but later he could not do
so much work as when he had taken no wine.
When the man took both food and wine, he could
do only about nine tenths as much work as when he
took food alone.</p>

<p>The most careful tests by other persons show that
whisky will not help a man do more work, lift a
heavier weight, or shoot straighter. In fact little
or much whisky makes him less able to do any of
these things.</p>

<p><b>Beer makes the Muscles Lazy.</b>&mdash;Doctor Parkes of
Netley secured two gangs of soldiers to do the same
kind of work. He allowed the first gang to drink
some beer, but the second gang were not allowed to
have any. During the first hour the beer gang
did the most work, but after that the temperance
gang did far more work during the entire day. The
next week beer was refused the first gang and given
to the second. The beer helped the second gang
do more work than the first one for nearly two hours,
but after that they did much less than the first gang.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
This shows that men who wish to do their best work
during the entire day should not use beer.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco and the Muscles.</b>&mdash;Many experiments and
studies have shown that the body cannot do its best
work when even very small amounts of poison are taken
day after day. The poison in tobacco is believed
to weaken the muscles so much that no man on a
football team in any of our large colleges or universities
is allowed to smoke or chew during the season.
Persons training for any contest where much strength
is required do not use tobacco in any form.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco prevents Growth of the Muscles.</b>&mdash;The
moderate use of tobacco by men has but little effect
on the muscles. It may cause them to tire a little
more easily when doing very hard work. Tobacco
poison does, however, show a marked effect on the
muscles of the young.</p>

<p>Very careful measurements made at one of the large
universities showed that the boys who did not smoke
grew one tenth more in weight and one fourth more
in height than those using tobacco regularly. This
slow growth in tobacco users is partly due to the fact
that tobacco makes the muscles in the walls of the
blood vessels squeeze together so as to shut off some
of the blood from the legs, arms, and other parts, so
that they get too little food. Tobacco may also cause
less food to be digested for the use of the body.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>HOW THE BODY IS GOVERNED</h3>

<p><b>Making the Parts of the Body Work.</b>&mdash;Each of the
hundreds of organs in the body has a certain work to
do and this must be done at the right time. In order
that all may work together and each one do its part
when needed, there is a chief manager called the <i>brain</i>
and a helping manager named the <i>spinal cord</i>. Millions
of tiny threads for sending messages connect the
two managers with every part of the body. These
threads form the <i>nerves</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Brain.</b>&mdash;The brain is a soft bunch of matter
filling the inside of the skull. The bones of the skull
are a quarter of an inch thick and prevent any common
knocks from hurting the brain. It is surrounded
by three coverings which also help shield it from
injury.</p>

<p>The surface of the brain is very uneven. There
are a great many folds separated by grooves. Some of
these are more than an inch deep.</p>

&mdash;The under side of the brain and the spinal cord with the chief nerves

</div>

<p><b>Parts of the Brain.</b>&mdash;The brain is divided into three
chief parts. The upper and larger part is called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
<i>big brain</i> or <i>cerebrum</i>. The lower part behind is the
<i>little brain</i> or <i>cerebellum</i>.
The part under
the little brain and
round like the thumb
is the <i>stem</i> of the brain.
It connects the larger
parts of the brain with
the spinal cord.</p>

<p>The big brain is
partly separated into
halves by a deep cut
called a <i>fissure</i>. Each
half is a <i>hemisphere</i>.</p>

<p>The outer layer of
the brain is gray. It
is made of millions of
tiny lumps of matter
which are the bodies
of nerve cells. These
are connected by
threads much finer
than hairs with other
parts of the brain
and spinal cord. Over
these threads called <i>nerve fibers</i> one cell can talk to
another somewhat as we talk over a telephone wire.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span><b>The Spinal Cord.</b>&mdash;This is a bundle of nerve matter
about as thick as your finger. It extends from the
stem of the brain
down the canal
in the backbone.
The outer layer
of the spinal cord
is white because
it is made of the
tiny threads, <i>nerve
fibers</i>. The inner
part is made of
the bodies of nerve
cells and therefore
looks gray. The fibers are branching threads
from the cells in the cord and brain.</p>

<p><b>The Message Carriers or Nerve Fibers.</b>&mdash;In order
that the managers may send messages, these fine
threads, the nerve fibers, extend from them to all
parts of the body. In many places from five to five
hundred or more of these fibers are united in one
white cord called a <i>nerve</i>.</p>

<p>Twelve pairs of nerves are joined to the under side
of the brain and thirty-one pairs are connected with
the spinal cord (<a href="#i149">Fig. 86</a>). The nerves of the brain
branch to all parts of the head and neck, and one
pair goes down to the lungs, heart, and stomach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
The nerves connected with the spinal cord branch to
every part of the muscles, bones, and skin of the arms,
trunk, and legs.</p>

<p><b>How the Nerves do their Work.</b>&mdash;On a telephone
wire we can send a message in either direction. A
message can travel on a nerve in only one direction.
For this reason there must be two kinds of nerves.
One kind is called <i>sending nerves</i> because the brain
and cord send orders over them to make the organs
act. The other kind carries messages to the brain
from the eyes, ears, skin, or other organs of sense,
telling it how they feel. On this account these are
named <i>receiving nerves</i>.</p>

<p>When we wish to catch a ball, the brain sends an
order along the nerve threads down the spinal cord
and out through the nerves of the arm to the fingers
to get ready to seize a ball. The fingers are spread
to grasp the ball, but they do not close until a
message goes from the skin of the finger tips to
the spinal cord, telling it that the ball is in the
hand.</p>

<p><b>The Work of the Brain.</b>&mdash;The brain is not only
the chief manager of the body, but the home of the
mind. The mind acts through the brain. The mind
receives through the brain what the eye sees, the
ear hears, the nose smells, and the fingers feel. All
this knowledge is stored up in the mind and called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
<i>memory</i>. These facts and others learned later are
worked over by the mind. This is called <i>thought</i>.</p>

<p>The mind rules and becomes good or bad according
to whether it contains good thoughts or bad thoughts.
<i>It is wrong to read books and papers about robberies
and murders or to tell or to listen to bad stories</i>,
because in this way evil thoughts get into the mind.
The best way of keeping badness out of the mind is
to fill it with goodness. It is said that Lincoln was
so busy thinking how he could help others that there
was no room in his mind for a bad thought. Doing
some kindness every day helps much in the making
of a good mind.</p>

<p><b>Habit.</b>&mdash;The doing of anything over and over
again until the body goes through the same motions
without any or very little thought is called <i>habit</i>.
The brain and nerves are so formed that when they
get used to obeying the same order of the mind again
and again, they will carry out these orders when the
mind no longer gives them. Sometimes they will
continue to obey the old orders even when new ones
are given.</p>

<p>Many persons would like to break off the habit of
drinking beer or whisky, of chewing tobacco, and using
bad language, but they find it very hard to make the
mind rule the body because they have let the nerves
have their own way so long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>Speaking cheerfully to those we meet, giving a kind
word to our friends, and looking pleasant are good
habits which every one ought to form in youth.
They not only make the mind better, but they help
the body to keep well and will prepare the way for
success in life later. Nobody wants a grumbling
clerk or a sour-faced housekeeper.</p>

&mdash;The difference in appearance between a pouting and a pleasant expression.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Parts of the Body work without Orders from the
Brain.</b>&mdash;A snake with its brain crushed will still
squirm and a chicken with its head cut off jumps
about. These movements are caused by orders sent
from the spinal cord. When the hand or foot is
being hurt, the spinal cord orders the muscles to
draw the limb away even before we feel the pain
in the brain. Many of the movements of the body
which are often repeated may be directed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
spinal cord, while the brain is left free to do other
work. This is why the spinal cord is called the helping
manager.</p>

<p>The action of the muscles in the walls of the blood
vessels, the working of the stomach, the liver, pancreas,
and other glands are not directed by the brain,
but by the <i>sympathetic nerves</i>. These extend from
a little cord on either side of the backbone to all
parts of the body and make the organs, such as the
heart and sweat glands, which we cannot make obey
our will, do their work.</p>

<p><b>Injury to the Nerves.</b>&mdash;The nerves are so important
for the welfare of the body that all the chief ones are
placed deep in the flesh, where they are not likely to
be hurt. If the nerves leading to the arm were cut,
it could not be moved, and we should have no
feeling in it. The hurting of a part of the brain, the
spinal cord, or the nerves may cause loss of feeling or
motion in the leg, arm, or other part of the body.
Such a part then seems asleep or dead and is said to
have <i>paralysis</i>.</p>

<p>Pressing on a nerve prevents it from acting. Sitting
so as to press on the nerve of the leg often makes
the foot go to sleep. The bursting of a blood vessel
in the brain may let a blood clot form and press on
the nerves which govern the arm or the leg. This
pressure may cause paralysis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span><b>Resting the Brain.</b>&mdash;When there is no food in the
stomach, it has time to rest. When we sit down or
lie down, the muscles get rest. The brain is always
busy except when we are asleep. No one can live
even a week without sleep. If a dog is kept awake
five days, it will die.</p>

<p>Children need much more sleep than older persons.
Men and women who work should have about eight
hours of sleep daily to remain in good health. Children
of twelve years should sleep nine hours each day;
those of ten years, ten hours; those of seven years,
eleven hours; and those of four years, twelve hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span><b>Getting the most out of Sleep.</b>&mdash;You should go to
bed every night at about the same hour. This will help
you to fall asleep as soon as you are in bed. Do not
sleep in the clothes which you have worn during the
day, but hang them up to air, and put on a night
robe.</p>

<p>Children should use a very low pillow, so that the
body can lie straight in the bed. This gives the lungs
and heart freedom to act. Do not lie on the back as
this causes some of the organs to press on certain
nerves and makes you dream. The windows should
be opened wide because fresh air is the best aid to
rest and health and keeps away tuberculosis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>HOW NARCOTICS AND STIMULANTS AFFECT THE<br />
BRAIN AND NERVES</h3>

<p><b>What Narcotics and Stimulants Are.</b>&mdash;A <i>narcotic</i>
is something which when taken into the body makes
the organs do their work more slowly and tends to
cause sleepiness. Alcoholic drinks, tobacco, opium,
soothing sirups, and pain killers are narcotics.</p>

<p>A <i>stimulant</i> is a substance which makes the organs
of the body do more and quicker work and does not
later make the organs work more slowly. Coffee
and tea are stimulants. Beer, wine, and whisky were
once thought to be stimulants, but experiments have
shown them to be narcotics. They urge the brain to
faster work for a few minutes, but a half hour later
they make it act slower than usual.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol hurts the Brain.</b>&mdash;Within five minutes
after a drink of beer or whisky has been swallowed,
part of the alcohol has reached the blood. Within
fifteen minutes much of the alcohol has gone from
the stomach directly into the blood. In a minute
after entering the blood vessels it reaches the brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>If much strong drink is taken, the cells of the brain
become so numbed that they cannot give the right
orders to the muscles to move the limbs. The person
then staggers about and is said to be drunk. Much
whisky taken will make the nerve cells so numb that
a man cannot move, and he will then lie down as if
in a deep sleep.</p>

<p>A tablespoonful of whisky will make a child drunk
and twice that amount may make him very sick.
Much use of strong drink sometimes gives to the
brain a terrible disease called <i>delirium tremens</i>. In
this sickness the man thinks he sees horned animals,
hissing snakes, and other creatures which annoy him.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol injures the Thinking Part of the Brain.</b>&mdash;It
was once thought that wine or whisky would
make a man think better. Now we know that either
of these drinks makes his thoughts slower and also
causes him to make mistakes.</p>

<p>Two doctors in Europe made many tests with men
to learn how alcohol affected their thinking. They
found that when using wine the men could do about
one tenth less work in adding numbers than when
they took no strong drink. These doctors also tested
the effect of alcohol on memory and discovered that
the use of even small quantities of liquor caused their
pupils to learn their lessons more slowly.</p>

<p>When persons have taken only a very little drink,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
they often say and do very foolish things. They
sometimes tell secrets, for which they are very sorry
when they get sober. Often they become angry at the
least cause and strike or even shoot any person who
seems to speak or work against them in any way.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol makes People Steal and Kill.</b>&mdash;The alcohol
in strong drink, when often used, appears to deaden
that part of the brain which helps the mind know
right from wrong. In one year the courts of Suffolk
County in Massachusetts found 17,000 persons guilty
of doing some wickedness and in over 12,000 of these
cases alcohol was found to be the cause of doing the
wrong for which they were arrested.</p>

<p>Some time ago there were collected the records of
30,000 prisoners, and among these over 12,000 had
done their wicked acts while alcohol was numbing the
brain. Lately another careful record of over 13,000
prisoners in twelve different states has been studied.
In over 4000 of these men the use of strong drink
was the first cause of their crimes.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol makes the Mind Sick.</b>&mdash;Since the mind
depends upon certain parts of the brain, whatever
hurts the brain is quite sure to hurt the mind.
When the mind cannot reason rightly, the person is
said to be <i>insane</i>. A study of 2000 insane men in
New York State showed that the use of alcoholic
drink was the cause of the mind sickness in over 500<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
of them. Of 687 persons in Massachusetts who were
so insane that they had to be cared for daily by
others, more than 200 of them were brought to this
sad condition by alcohol.</p>

<p><b>Brain of the Young easily overcome by Alcohol.</b>&mdash;No
one expects to become a drunkard or a criminal
when he first begins to drink. The continued use of
alcohol, however, soon numbs the brain and weakens
the mind, so that the person's will power is lost. He
is then not able to quit drinking even though he
wants to stop. He has become a slave to alcohol.</p>

<p><i>The brain of a young person is injured much more
quickly by alcohol than that of an older person and he</i>
is much more likely to become a slave than one who
begins the use of drink late in life. Doctor Lambert,
of New York, studied the cases of 259 slaves to alcohol.
He learned that four began to drink before
six years of age; thirteen between six and twelve
years of age; sixty, between twelve and sixteen
years; 102 between sixteen and twenty-one years;
seventy-one, between twenty-one and thirty years;
and only eight after thirty years of age. These facts
teach that it is dangerous for the young to take
strong drink at any time.</p>

<p><b>Laws against Alcohol.</b>&mdash;The men who make laws
for the good of the people are learning that alcohol
is injuring the mind and body of many persons every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
year. For this reason laws have lately been passed
forbidding the sale of strong drink in several entire
states and in large parts of many other states.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco makes the Brain work Slower.</b>&mdash;An examination
of the age and habits of hundreds of the students
entering a large university in New England
showed that those who smoked required more than a
year longer than those who did not use tobacco, to
learn enough to enter the first classes in this school.
Moreover, out of every hundred of those who took
the highest rank in their work in the university,
ninety-five did not use tobacco. It is likely that
tobacco makes the mind work slower by preventing
the full amount of blood from going to the brain. It
does this by making the blood vessels smaller.</p>

<p>So far as known tobacco has but little effect upon
the brains of older persons.</p>

<p>Superintendent Ogg of Indiana reports that the occasional
users of cigarettes are a year, and the regular
users two years, behind those who do not smoke. The
conduct and honesty of the smokers were also found
to be lower than among those who did not smoke.</p>

<p><b>Opium, Morphine, and Cocaine.</b>&mdash;All of these harmful
drugs are widely used in our country. They act
on the brain in a strange way. All of them deaden
pain. When a person first begins their use, only a
small amount is required to produce the effect wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
on the body. Later the doses must be increased.
After a few months' use the person becomes a slave
to the habit of using them, and he cannot stop their
use without the help of a doctor. It is therefore
dangerous to use these drugs at any time.</p>

<p>Powders used for colds in the nose, also paregoric
and laudanum, contain these harmful drugs.</p>

<p><b>Pain Killers and Soothing Sirups.</b>&mdash;All pain killers
contain opium or morphine or other harmful drugs.
They are therefore dangerous to use. Pain is useful
in telling us that some organ is out of order and needs
care. Killing the pain does not help the sick organ,
and it may let the organ get so sick as to cause death.</p>

<p>One use of the nerves is to tell us when any part
of the body is hurt or sick. Pain is nature's warning,
and to numb the nerves which tell us about it is as
foolish as to kill a person because he brings us bad
news. <i>No medicine should ever be given children to
make them sleep or stop their crying except by the
advice of the physician.</i></p>

<p><b>Powders and Pills.</b>&mdash;If you get sick, do not try to
cure yourself with pills or powders bought at the store.
Some of these medicines contain poisons which hurt
the heart or other organs. A number of persons have
been killed by taking such medicines. When you are
sick, go to a good doctor who understands how the
organs should work, and he will find which one is out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
of order and tell you exactly what medicine you need
and what to eat in order to get well quickly.</p>

<p><b>Tea and Coffee.</b>&mdash;These drinks usually wake up the
brain and make it work better for a time. If too much
of them is used, they may excite the brain in such a way
as to make persons nervous. If taken for supper, they
may prevent sleep. Children should not use either
tea or coffee. Tea sometimes disturbs digestion, and
coffee may injure both the stomach and the heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE SENSES, OR DOORS OF KNOWLEDGE</h3>

<p><b>The Organs of Sense.</b>&mdash;In order that our body
may keep out of the way of other persons and find
food and drink and do its work, the brain must have
some way of receiving news about what is near
us, how it looks, and of what it is made. Special
organs for receiving knowledge of people and things
about us are scattered over the surface of the body.
They are called <i>sense organs</i>. The chief ones are
the two eyes, the two ears, the nose, and many
organs of taste in the mouth, and the thousands of
tiny organs of feeling in the skin.</p>

<p><b>The Eye.</b>&mdash;The eye consists of a globe called the
<i>eyeball</i> and parts which move this and protect it
from injury. Each eyeball is attached at its back
part to the large nerve of sight (<a href="#i165">Fig. 90</a>). This carries
messages to the brain, telling it what the eye sees.</p>

<p>The eyeball is held in a socket in the front of the
skull. A layer of fat lines the socket and keeps the
eye from being injured by jars. The <i>eyebrows</i> at
the lower edge of the forehead prevent the sweat
from running into the eyeball.</p>

&mdash;Side of the face cut away to show the eyeball in its socket. <i>n</i> is the nerve of sight;

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>The <i>eyelids</i> can close over the front of the eyeball
to shut out dirt or anything else likely to hurt it. The
lids have learned
to do their work
so well that we do
not need to think
to close them when
anything flies toward
the eye, for
they are shut before
we can think.</p>

<p>A salty fluid
called <i>tears</i> flows
from the tear gland at the upper and outer side of the
eyeball. The tears keep the front of the eyeball clean.</p>

<p><b>Parts of the Eyeball.</b>&mdash;The outside of the eyeball
is a tough white coat except in front, where it is as
clear as glass. Within the outer coat is a very thin
black lining to keep the light from scattering. In
front the lining is not against the outer coat, but
hangs loose and has in it a round hole called the
<i>pupil</i> to let the light pass through. The part around
the hole is the <i>iris</i>. It may be blue, black, or brown,
and can squeeze up so as to make the pupil very
small when the light is strong.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 91</span>
&mdash;A slice from before backward through the eye.</p>
</div>

<p>The end of the nerve of sight forms a tender pink
covering over most of the inner surface of the eyeball.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
The cavity within the eyeball is filled with three
clear substances. The
<i>lens</i>, shaped like a
flat door knob, is
fixed just behind the
pupil. In front of the
lens is a <i>watery fluid</i>
and behind it is a clear
<i>jellylike mass</i>. The use
of the lens and also
the other substances
is to bend the rays of
light together so that they will meet at one place.</p>

<p><b>How the Eyeball is Moved.</b>&mdash;Six muscles fixed to
the bones of the socket holding the eye have their
other ends fastened to the tough coat of the eyeball.
One muscle turns the ball upward, another turns it
downward, one turns it inward and another turns
it outward. If an inner or an outer muscle is
too strong, a person may have cross eyes.</p>

<p><b>Keeping the Eye Strong.</b>&mdash;Nearly all young children
have perfect eyes. After a year or two in
school the eyes of some children become weak.
Many children get weak eyes after they are ten or
twelve years old. This is because they have not
taken care of the eyes.</p>

<p>The eyes are often hurt by reading a book with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
fine print, reading in a dim light, or by leaning over
the book so that the eyes look downward instead of
straight forward. As the eyes are very weak after
measles and most other diseases, they should not be
used much until a week or more after recovery.</p>

<p>In reading the book should be held a little over a
foot in front of the chest and you should sit nearly
straight and let the light fall on the page from one
side. Never read while lying down because it strains
the eyes. Stop reading as soon as the eyes smart.</p>

<p><b>Helping the Eyes to See.</b>&mdash;Very few old people
can see to read without the help of glasses, because
the lens of the eye hardens in old age. To see things
near by, the shape of the lens must be changed. In
some children, the shape of the eyes has become so
changed by straining them to read fine print or see
things in a dim light that the eyes hurt after being
used for any kind of work, and the head may often
ache and make the whole body feel bad. Such eyes
need help. You should have them examined by
an eye doctor who can fit you with glasses which
will help you see clearly without headache.</p>

<p><b>Keeping the Eyes Well.</b>&mdash;Bits of dirt often get
beneath the eyelids and cause much pain. By taking
hold of the eyelashes the lid may be pulled out from
the eye and any dirt removed with the corner of a
clean handkerchief passed gently along the lid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>The eyes sometimes become sore because they are
rubbed with soiled fingers on which are germs. These
germs get inside the lids and grow, and in this way
poison the eyes. Unless care is used sore eyes are
likely to spread from one child to another in the
school. The sick child rubs its eyes and then handles
a book or pencil on which the germs are smeared by
the fingers which touched the eyes. The next child
picks up the same book later, gets the germs on the
fingers, and then rubs the eyes. For this reason you
should never rub the eyes. If you have sore eyes, <i>be
careful that no one else catches the sickness from you</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Ear.</b>&mdash;The ear is made of three parts called
the <i>outer ear</i>, the <i>middle ear</i> or <i>eardrum</i>, and the
<i>inner ear</i>. The outer ear is made of a plate of skin
and gristle and a slightly bent tube about one inch
long. At the inner end of this tube is a thin membrane
or <i>drumhead</i>. Beyond the drumhead is the
cavity of the middle ear about as large as a pea. A
chain of three tiny bones stretches from the outer
drumhead across this cavity to a tiny <i>inner drumhead</i>.
Beyond the inner drumhead is the inner ear.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i169" id="i169"></a>
<img src="images/i169.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="The ear" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 92</span>
&mdash;View of the ear from in front. Three little bones stretch across
the middle ear.</p>
</div>

<p>The middle ear is kept full of air by means of a
tube leading from it to the throat. A cold or other
sickness may cause this tube to fill up and make you
deaf. The inner ear consists of a sac and four bent
tubes filled with a watery fluid. They are also surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
by watery fluid contained in channels in a
bone of the skull. The end of the nerve of hearing
is on one of the tubes.</p>

<p><b>How we Hear.</b>&mdash;Throwing a stone in the water
makes waves which move farther and farther outward.
In the same way a noise causes waves in the air.
These waves pass into the ear tube, strike the outer
drumhead, and make it move. This moves the chain
of bones in the middle ear so that they cause motion
in the inner drumhead. This in moving back and
forth makes waves in the fluid of the inner ear which
strike on the ends of the nerve of hearing and cause
messages to be carried to the brain.</p>

<p><b>Care of the Ears.</b>&mdash;The ears should not be struck
or pulled, as the eardrum is easily broken. Do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
put pencils, pins, or anything else in your ears. Wax
naturally forms in the ear tube to keep out bugs and
flies. The outer part of the tube may be kept clean
by wiping it with a moist cloth over the little finger.
If you often have earache or a running ear, you
should have it examined by a physician. <i>Neglecting
a sick ear may cause deafness.</i></p>

<p>Some persons are deaf in one ear and do not know
it. Test each ear by covering the other one with a
heavy cloth and note how far off you can hear the
ticks of a watch.</p>

<p><b>The Nose.</b>&mdash;The nose has a skinlike lining, but it
is always kept moist by little glands which give out
a watery fluid. The endings of the nerve of smell
are in the lining in the upper part of the nose. Two
nerves lead from the nose to the brain.</p>

<p>When we catch cold, much blood rushes to the lining
of the nose and it becomes swollen. It then gives
out a thick white mucus. This covers the nerve endings,
so that we cannot smell.</p>

<p>Smell is of great use in telling us whether our food
is good, by helping us to enjoy food with a pleasant
odor, and by warning us against bad air.</p>

<p><b>The Sense of Taste.</b>&mdash;The nerves by which we
taste end in the soft covering of the tongue and some
other parts of the mouth. A food cannot be tasted
while it is dry. For this reason much slippery fluid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
flows into the mouth from glands under the ears and
tongue. This fluid, called <i>saliva</i>, softens the solid food
when it is well chewed, so we can taste it.</p>

<p><b>The Senses of the Skin.</b>&mdash;There are endings of
nerves in the skin all over the body. They are of
three or four different kinds. Some of them tell us
about heat, others tell us about cold. Some tell us
about the shape, the smoothness, or hardness of objects,
while others tell us when the skin gets hurt.</p>

<p>Most of the nerve endings are in the deeper part of
the skin, so that they are covered by the epidermis
and cannot be hurt by the rough things handled.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol and the Senses.</b>&mdash;The senses are but little
affected by a small amount of alcoholic drink. The
sense of taste, after being accustomed to the sharpness
of strong drink, may be less easily pleased with the
taste of common food and drink.</p>

<p>The use of large amounts of alcohol blunts all the
senses. In a drunken man the senses of the skin are
so numbed that he does not know when anything
touches him, and he may be badly burned before he
feels the pain.</p>

<p>Heavy drinking makes the hearing less keen, enlarges
the blood vessels of the eyes, and makes them
appear red and bloodshot.</p>

<p><b>Tobacco and the Senses.</b>&mdash;The use of tobacco does
not injure the senses of the skin and usually has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
effect on hearing. Both chewing and smoking, if
much practiced, make the sense of taste less delicate,
so that one cannot enjoy his food to the fullest extent.</p>

<p>Much smoking of tobacco may hurt the nerve of
sight and in a few cases it has made men blind. Many
boys have weakened their eyes by the use of cigarettes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>KEEPING AWAY SICKNESS</h3>

<p><b>Too Much Sickness.</b>&mdash;Many diseases are caused by
our own carelessness and our bad habits of living.
We have about one doctor for every one hundred
families. There are enough people sick every day to
make a city as large as New York or to equal the
number of people living in the thirteen states of
Idaho, Nevada, Wyoming, Arizona, New Mexico,
Utah, Delaware, Montana, Vermont, New Hampshire,
North Dakota and South Dakota, and Oklahoma.</p>

<p>A careful study of disease and its cause shows that
at least one half of all the sickness in our land can
be avoided by right living.</p>

<p><b>The Cause of Sickness.</b>&mdash;Some people are so foolish
as to make themselves sick. They weaken the body
by using much beer or wine, by breathing bad air, by
lack of exercise, or by fast eating. When the body
becomes weak, it is likely to get sick at any time.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i174" id="i174"></a>
<img src="images/i174.jpg" width="150" height="140" alt="Germs" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 93</span>
&mdash;The germs of diseases. Much enlarged.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not always our own fault when we are sick.
It may be caused by the carelessness of others who
have let germs escape from their bodies so that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
are able to reach us. One half of the sickness in our
land is catching sickness. That is, it is sickness which
passes from one
person to another
and is caused by
tiny germs or microbes.
A catching
sickness is
called a <i>contagious
disease</i>. Some of
the common catching
diseases are
sore throat, colds,
diphtheria, pneumonia,
typhoid fever, measles, grippe, and whooping
cough.</p>

<p><b>How we get a Catching Sickness.</b>&mdash;We get a catching
sickness by taking into our bodies the germs from
some other person. The germs of the sick do not pass
off in the breath, but in the spit or anything else which
comes from their bodies. This is why the spit and
all slops from the sick room should be burned, buried,
or destroyed in some way.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i175" id="i175"></a>
<img src="images/i175.jpg" width="150" height="195" alt="The path of germs" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 94</span>
&mdash;How the germs of disease start on their mission of death. This sewer
carries slops from the houses of the sick and well and empties into a stream
used below for drinking water.</p>
</div>

<p>We should think it very wicked if a showman should
turn his lions and tigers loose in a crowd of women
and children. Somebody would surely be killed and
others hurt. It is just as wrong to turn loose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
germs of the sick by throwing the spit and the slops
where they will get into a stream or where the flies
may find them and by
soiling their feet leave
death in their trail
wherever they crawl.</p>

<p><b>How the Germs of
Sickness catch Us.</b>&mdash;The
germs of sickness
have no feet to walk
and no wings to fly,
yet they easily travel
from the sick to the
well. They are not
killed by being frozen,
or drowned by floating
in water, or destroyed
by drying.
For this reason they can travel with the ice, water,
milk, and dust.</p>

<p>In Buffalo, New York, fifty-seven children caught
the scarlet fever in one week by using milk cared for
by a boy who was getting well from the scarlet fever.</p>

<p>The germs of sickness are so small that a million
can hang to the hands or clothing and not be seen.
For this reason they are often left clinging to the
fingers, desks, books, and pencils, and travel in large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
numbers on the feet of flies. The surest way the
germs have of getting from one person to another is
by the common drinking cup.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i176" id="i176"></a>
<img src="images/i176.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Clear beef broth jelly" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 95</span>
&mdash;Photograph of clear beef broth jelly in which a fly walked
five minutes scattering germs. Two days later each germ brushed
off the fly's feet grew into a city of germs appearing as a white spot.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Common Drinking Cup is an Exchange Station
for Germs.</b>&mdash;The most careful examinations have
shown that there are
thousands of children as
well as grown persons
who have very light attacks
of scarlet fever,
tuberculosis, or other diseases
and go to school or
about their work scattering
the germs of sickness
in their spit. A child
seldom drinks from a
cup without leaving on
it thousands of germs.
Some of these may be germs which will cause sickness.
On one drinking cup used in a school, the
germs were found to be as thick as the leaves on a
maple tree in June.</p>

<p>In an Ohio school one warm day, a boy with beginning
measles drank from the cup which was afterward
used on the same day by the teacher and all the
other pupils. In less than two weeks every pupil
and the teacher were suffering from measles. <i>Put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
nothing into your mouth which has been in another's
mouth.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 96</span>
&mdash;A schoolhouse in Morgan county, Ohio, where sixteen pupils and the
teacher caught the measles in one day by drinking from a cup which had been
used by a boy sick with the measles.</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Golden Rule.</b>&mdash;If you have a catching sickness,
such as measles, chicken pox, or whooping
cough, stay away from others. Since the germs of
some diseases, like
scarlet fever and diphtheria,
remain in the
spit sometimes several
months after you feel
well, don't scatter
your spit. Hold a
handkerchief before
your face when you
sneeze or cough. <i>Wash
your hands before
handling food.</i></p>

<p><b>Some Animals carry Sickness.</b>&mdash;Mosquitoes carry
malaria and yellow fever and some other diseases.
Flies carry typhoid fever, grippe, diphtheria, and
tuberculosis. Bedbugs and fleas carry the plague and
leprosy. Rats carry the plague. Cats sometimes
carry diphtheria. Many cows have tuberculosis and
the germs of this disease are then sometimes found
in their milk. Some children have caught tuberculosis
from drinking such milk.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 97</span>
&mdash;A pane of glass held about two feet before the face of a boy who sneezed. The spots are the
droplets of spit thrown out. Each spot showed under the microscope from 50 to 1000 germs.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Keeping away Smallpox.</b>&mdash;Smallpox was once the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
most terrible of all diseases. It is so catching that
two or three were often sick with it at one time in the
same family. Sometimes nearly one half the people
of a whole town would have the disease in one year.
Over a hundred
years ago
nearly every
grown up person
had little
pits scattered
over his face
as a result of
having had
smallpox.</p>

<p>You can always
keep
away smallpox
by being vaccinated. The doctor can vaccinate you
by putting on the freshly scraped skin of your arm
some weak smallpox germs from a clean healthy calf
which has been vaccinated. Your arm will in a few
days get sore and you will not feel well for about one
week, but you will be made safe from smallpox for
several years.</p>

<p>Fifty nurses were vaccinated in Philadelphia and
cared for many sick with the smallpox, staying with
them day after day, but not one of the nurses took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the disease. <i>Every one should be vaccinated when a
year old and again at the age of ten or twelve years.</i></p>

<p><b>Colds.</b>&mdash;Some colds are catching, but we generally
take cold because we have weak bodies or have been
careless. If you want to be free from colds, remember
these six rules:&mdash;</p>

<p>Don't sit still in wet clothes or with wet feet.</p>

<p>Don't sit in a cold draft or in a cold room.</p>

<p>Don't sit on the damp ground or on the ice when
you are resting from skating.</p>

<p>Don't cool off quickly after exercising.</p>

<p>Sleep in a room with the windows <i>wide</i> open.</p>

<p>Take a cold bath every morning and draw fresh
air to the bottom of the lungs many times every day.</p>

<p><b>Tuberculosis or Consumption.</b>&mdash;This disease is so
common and deadly that twenty persons die from it
in our country every hour. It is caused by tiny
germs (<a href="#i108bottom">Fig. 63</a>) which lodge in the lungs, glands,
bones, or other parts of the body, where they give off
poison and hurt the tissues. We take these germs
into the body with dust or food, and also by putting
to the lips a drinking cup or other things used by a
consumptive. Generally the germs will not grow in
a strong body, even when they have lodged there.</p>

<p><b>Preventing Consumption.</b>&mdash;Living in poorly lighted
houses without much fresh air, working in dusty
rooms, using much strong drink and tobacco, eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
poor food, losing sleep, neglecting a cough, and taking
little or no outdoor exercise weaken the body so
that the consumption germs can grow in it. Deep
breathing, sitting and walking erect, living in rooms
with sunshine, sleeping with the windows open eight
or nine hours every night, and eating good food
will prevent one from taking consumption and will
often cure the disease. Persons with this sickness
give out the germs in their spit, which should be
caught in a cup and burned.</p>

<p><b>The Hookworm Disease.</b>&mdash;This is a sickness affecting
thousands of persons in the South. It is caused
by tiny worms half as large as a pin hanging fast to
the lining of the bowels. The worm is sometimes
called the lazy germ because it destroys the red blood
cells and makes the body feel weak and lazy. Children
with these worms grow slowly, have a dry skin,
and a swollen abdomen with a tender spot below the
stomach.</p>

<p>The disease is easily cured by a physician, but it is
better to prevent it by killing the germs in the waste
from the bowels. For directions, address the Department
of Health at the capital of your state. If the
germs reach the ground they crawl around and may
get into the well, and enter the body again with the
drinking water. Generally, however, the worms
enter through the skin of those going barefooted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
are carried by the blood to the lungs. From here
they go up the windpipe to the throat, and then down
the gullet to the bowels. It is their entrance through
the skin that causes ground itch or dew itch. Wearing
shoes will help prevent the disease.</p>

<p><b>A Strong Body Wins.</b>&mdash;Nobody wants to be weak
and sickly. Most all of us could keep well if we
would try in the right way to keep the body strong.</p>

<p>To keep the body in health it must have plenty of
sleep, enough good food well chewed, plenty of clean
water, exercise every day, and an abundance of fresh
air. The body is the temple of the soul. Don't hurt
it with bad habits.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>HELPING BEFORE THE DOCTOR COMES</h3>

<p><b>The Need of Quick Help.</b>&mdash;In many places in the
country, or when out camping, it is impossible to get
a doctor in less than two or three hours. Unless
some one at hand can give aid before the doctor
comes, much suffering and even death may result
when a simple accident occurs. For this reason
every one should know how to help in case of such
accidents as burns, bleeding, choking, and sunstroke.</p>

<p><b>Clothing on Fire.</b>&mdash;Children should never play
about an open fire. A single spark lighting on a
cotton dress may cause it to burst into a blaze so that
within a few minutes the child is enveloped in flames.</p>

<p>The quickest way to put out such a fire is to wrap
the child in a blanket, a piece of carpet, a coat, or any
part of your clothing quickly removed. If nothing
is at hand to wrap the sufferer in, roll him over and
over in the dirt or weeds until the flames are smothered.
When your clothing is on fire, you must not
run, because this fans the fire and makes it burn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span><b>Burns and Scalds.</b>&mdash;If there is clothing on the
part burned, it should be taken off slowly so as not to
tear the skin. If the clothing sticks, soak it in oil a
few minutes until it gets loose. Cover the burned
part as quickly as possible with vaseline or a clean
cloth soaked in a quart of boiled water containing a
cup of washing soda. Let nothing dirty touch the
burned surface and keep it well wrapped.</p>

<p><b>Bleeding.</b>&mdash;A person can lose a quart of blood
without danger of death and may live after more
than two quarts have been lost, but it is wise to try
to stop any flow of blood as quickly as possible.
Tying a clean cloth folded several times over the cut
will in most cases stop the flow. This will help a
clot to form and will also close the ends of the cut
vessels if the bandage is twisted tight with a stick.</p>

<p>If the cut is on a limb and the blood comes out in
spurts, a bandage tied about the limb between the cut
and the body may be twisted tight with a stick so as
to press upon the artery and close it. A piece of
wood or folded cloth placed over the artery under the
bandage before it is tightened is helpful.</p>

<p><b>Nosebleed.</b>&mdash;Some persons are troubled frequently
with bleeding from the nose. The least knock may
cause it to bleed for more than an hour. It may
generally be stopped without sending for a doctor.</p>

<p>Sit up straight to keep the blood out of the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and press the middle part of the nose firmly between
the fingers. Apply a cold wet cloth or a lump of ice
wrapped in a cloth to the back of the neck. Put a
bag of pounded ice on the root of the nose. If it
does not stop in a half hour, wet a soft rag or a piece
of cotton with cold tea or alum water and put it
gently into the bleeding nostril so as to entirely close
it. Do not blow the nose for several hours after the
bleeding has stopped as this may start it again.</p>

<p><b>Fainting.</b>&mdash;Fainting may be caused by bad air, an
overheated room, by fear, or by some other excitement.
A fainting person falls down and appears to be
asleep. The lips are pale and there may be cold
sweat on the forehead. There is too little blood in
the brain, and the heart is weak.</p>

<p>A fainting person should be laid flat on the floor or
on a couch, and all doors and windows opened wide.
Loosen all tight clothing and apply to the forehead
a cloth wet with cold water. A faint usually lasts
only a few minutes.</p>

<p><b>Sunstroke.</b>&mdash;A person with sunstroke becomes
giddy, sick at the stomach, and weak. He then gets
drowsy and may seem as if asleep, but he cannot be
aroused. The skin is hot and dry instead of being
cold and pale, as in fainting. The doctor should be
sent for at once.</p>

<p>The first aid for sunstroke is to put the patient in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
a cool cellar or an icehouse, raise the head, and wet
the head, neck, and back of the chest with cold
water. As soon as he wakens put him in a cool
room.</p>

<p><b>Frostbite.</b>&mdash;When out in very cold weather, the
end of the nose, the tips of the ears, and the toes and
fingers are sometimes frozen. If a person comes into
a warm room, these frozen parts will give much pain.
The parts should be rubbed with snow or ice water
until a tingling sensation is felt.</p>

<p><b>Breaks in the Skin.</b>&mdash;A small cut or tear in the
skin may become very sore and cause much trouble
if not cared for so as to keep the germs out. If there
is dirt in the wound, as when made with a rusty nail
or by the bite of a dog, it should be squeezed and
washed with boiled water to make it perfectly clean.
It may then be bound up in a clean cloth. A little
turpentine poured on the wound will help kill the
germs which may make it sore. If the dog is thought
to be mad or the wound is too deep to be easily
washed out to the bottom, a doctor should be called.</p>

<p><b>Snakebite.</b>&mdash;The scratches made by the little
teeth of most snakes, such as the milk snake, garter
snake, and black snake, do no more harm than the
scratch of a pin. The <i>copperhead</i>, the <i>southern moccasin</i>,
and the <i>rattlesnake</i> have a pair of long teeth
called <i>fangs</i> in the upper jaw. These teeth have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
little canals in them through which the snake presses
poison into the bite.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="i186" id="i186"></a>
<img src="images/i186.jpg" width="150" height="145" alt="Copperhead snake" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><span class="fig">Fig. 98</span>
&mdash;Photograph of a copperhead snake whose bite may cause death.</p>
</div>

<p>If a person is bitten
by one of these snakes,
the doctor must be sent
for and help given at
once. Put a bandage
above the bite and twist
it tight with a stick.
Make two or three deep
cuts into the bitten place
to let out the poisoned
blood. Suck the wound to draw out the poison and
apply ammonia.</p>

<p><b>Choking.</b>&mdash;A hard piece of meat, a bone, or a peach
seed may slip back into the throat and press so hard
on the windpipe as to cut off the air from the lungs.
If the object is not far back in the throat, it may be
seized with the first finger. A few smart slaps on
the upper part of the back while the body is bent
forward may drive enough air out of the lungs to
push the object outward.</p>

<p><b>Drowning.</b>&mdash;Every one should learn to swim while
young, but no one should venture in deep water. Stiffening
of the muscles called cramps often causes the
best swimmer to drown.</p>

<p>After a person has been under the water two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
three minutes he appears lifeless. He may, however,
be brought to life if laid face downward, his clothes
loosened, and the lungs made to breathe. A heavy
folded coat, a piece of sod, or a bunch of weeds should
be put under the chest. Then standing astride of
him place the hands on the lower ribs and bend forward
gradually so as to press on the ribs and push
the air out of the lungs. Then straighten your body
and slowly lessen pressure on the patient's ribs so
that the air will run into the lungs. In this way
make the air go in and out of the lungs about fifteen
times each minute.</p>

<p><b>Poisoning.</b>&mdash;Whenever a person has taken poison, a
physician should be sent for at once. In most cases
an effort should be made to get the poison out of the
stomach by causing vomiting. A glass or two of
weak, warm soapsuds, a pint of water with a tablespoonful
of mustard, or a glass of water with two
tablespoonfuls of salt may be taken to make the
stomach throw out the poison. Tickling the throat
<a name="back" id="back"></a>back of the tongue will help cause vomiting.</p>

<p>If a strong acid such as carbolic acid or a strong
alkali such as ammonia has been taken, do not cause
vomiting. For acids give chalk in warm water and
a pint of milk. For an alkali give vinegar in water.</p>

<h2>BALDWIN AND BENDER'S<br />
READERS</h2>

<p class="center">Reading with Expression</p>

<blockquote><p>By JAMES BALDWIN, Author of Baldwin's School Readers,
Harper's Readers, etc. and IDA C. BENDER,
Supervisor of Primary Grades, Buffalo, New York.</p>

<p>AN EIGHT BOOK SERIES or A FIVE BOOK SERIES</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p>The authorship of this series is conclusive evidence of
its rare worth, of its happy union of the ideal and the
practical. The chief design of the books is to help pupils
to acquire the art and habit of reading so well as to give pleasure
both to themselves and to those who listen to them. They
teach reading with expression, and the selections have, to a
large extent, been chosen for this purpose.</p>

<p>&para; These readers are very teachable and readable, and are unusually
interesting both in selections and in illustrations. The
selections are of a very high literary quality. Besides the
choicest schoolbook classics, there are a large number which
have never before appeared in school readers. The contents
are well balanced between prose and poetry, and the subject
matter is unusually varied. Beginning with the Third Reader,
selections relating to similar subjects or requiring similar
methods of study or recitation, are grouped together. Many
selections are in dialogue form and suitable for dramatization.</p>

<p>&para; The First Reader may be used with any method of teaching
reading, for it combines the best ideas of each. A number
of helpful new features are also included. Each reading lesson
is on a right-hand page, and is approached by a series of preparatory
exercises on the preceding left-hand page.</p>

<p>&para; The illustrations constitute the finest and most attractive
collection ever brought together in a series of readers. There
are over 600 in all, every one made especially for these books
by an artist of national reputation.</p>

<h2>HICKS'S CHAMPION<br />
SPELLING BOOK</h2>

<p class="center">By WARREN E. HICKS, Assistant Superintendent of<br />
Schools, Cleveland, Ohio</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">Complete, $0.25&mdash;Part One, $0.18&mdash;Part Two, $0.18</p>

<hr />

<p>This book embodies the method that enabled the pupils
in the Cleveland schools after two years to win the National
Education Association Spelling Contest of 1908.</p>

<p>&para; By this method a spelling lesson of ten words is given each
day from the spoken vocabulary of the pupil. Of these ten
words two are selected for intensive study, and in the spelling
book are made prominent in both position and type at the head
of each day's lessons, these two words being followed by the
remaining eight words in smaller type. Systematic review is
provided throughout the book. Each of the ten prominent
words taught intensively in a week is listed as a subordinate
word in the next two weeks; included in a written spelling
contest at the end of eight weeks; again in the annual contest
at the end of the year; and again as a subordinate word in the
following year's work;&mdash;used five times in all within two
years.</p>

<p>&para; The Champion Spelling Book consists of a series of lessons
arranged as above for six school years, from the third to the
eighth, inclusive. It presents about 1,200 words each year,
and teaches 312 of them with especial clearness and intensity.
It also includes occasional supplementary exercises which serve
as aids in teaching sounds, vowels, homonyms, rules of spelling,
abbreviated forms, suffixes, prefixes, the use of hyphens,
plurals, dictation work, and word building. The words have
been selected from lists, supplied by grade teachers of Cleveland
schools, of words ordinarily misspelled by the pupils of
their respective grades.</p>

<h2>SPENCERS' PRACTICAL<br />
WRITING</h2>

<h3>By PLATT R. SPENCER'S SONS</h3>

<hr />

<p class="center">Books 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Per dozen, $0.60</p>

<hr />

<p>SPENCERS' PRACTICAL WRITING has been devised
because of the distinct and wide-spread reaction from the
use of vertical writing in schools. It is thoroughly up-to-date,
embodying all the advantages of the old and of the
new. Each word can be written by one continuous movement
of the pen.</p>

<p>&para; The books teach a plain, practical hand, moderate in slant,
and free from ornamental curves, shades, and meaningless
lines. The stem letters are long enough to be clear and unmistakable.
The capitals are about two spaces in height.</p>

<p>&para; The copies begin with words and gradually develop into
sentences. The letters, both large and small, are taught
systematically. In the first two books the writing is somewhat
larger than is customary because it is more easily learned
by young children. These books also contain many illustrations
in outline. The ruling is very simple.</p>

<p>&para; Instruction is afforded showing how the pupil should sit at
the desk, and hold the pen and paper. A series of drill movement
exercises, thirty-three in number, with directions for
their use, accompanies each book.</p>

<hr />

<h3>SPENCERIAN PRACTICAL WRITING SPELLER</h3>

<p class="center">Per dozen, $0.48</p>

<p>This simple, inexpensive device provides abundant drill in writing
words. At the same time it trains pupils to form their copies in
accordance with the most modern and popular system of penmanship,
and saves much valuable time for both teacher and pupil.</p>

<p>The ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR presents in very
small space all the grammar usually taught in elementary
schools.</p>

<p>&para; It gives the pupil an insight into the general forms in which
thought is expressed, and enables him to see the meaning of
complicated sentences. The explanatory matter is made
clear by the use of simple language, by the elimination of
unnecessary technical terms, and by the frequent introduction
of illustrative sentences. The definitions are simple and precise.
The exercises are abundant and peculiarly ingenious.
A novel device for parsing and analysis permits these two
subjects to be combined in one exercise for purposes of drill.</p>

<p>&para; The SCHOOL GRAMMAR contains everything needed
by students in upper grammar grades and secondary schools.
It covers fully the requirements of the Syllabus in English
issued by the New York State Education Department.</p>

<p>&para; The book treats of grammar only, and presents many
exercises which call for considerable reflection on the meaning
of the expressions to be analyzed. Throughout, stress
is laid on the broader distinctions of thought and expression.
The common errors of written and spoken language are so
classified as to make it comparatively easy for pupils to
detect and correct them through the application of the rules
of grammar. The book ends with an historical sketch of
the English language, an article on the formation of words,
and a list of equivalent terms employed by other grammarians.
The full index makes the volume useful for reference.</p>
